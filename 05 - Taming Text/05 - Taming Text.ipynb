    "## Deadline\n",
    "Thursday December 15, 2016 at 11:59PM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "* Make sure you push on GitHub your Notebook with all the cells already evaluated\n",
    "* Don't forget to add a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, and the solution\n",
    "you plan to implement!\n",
    "* Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "In this homework you will explore a relatively large corpus of emails released in public during the\n",
    "[Hillary Clinton email controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy).\n",
    "You can find the corpus in the `hillary-clinton-emails` directory of this repository, while more detailed information \n",
    "about the [schema is available here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "1. Generate a word cloud based on the raw corpus -- I recommend you to use the [Python word_cloud library](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud).\n",
    "With the help of `nltk` (already available in your Anaconda environment), implement a standard text pre-processing \n",
    "pipeline (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.) and generate a new word cloud. Discuss briefly the pros and\n",
    "cons (if any) of the two word clouds you generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find all the mentions of world countries in the whole corpus, using the `pycountry` utility (*HINT*: remember that\n",
    "there will be different surface forms for the same country in the text, e.g., Switzerland, switzerland, CH, etc.)\n",
    "Perform sentiment analysis on every email message using the demo methods in the `nltk.sentiment.util` module. Aggregate \n",
    "the polarity information of all the emails by country, and plot a histogram (ordered and colored by polarity level)\n",
    "that summarizes the perception of the different countries. Repeat the aggregation + plotting steps using different demo\n",
    "methods from the sentiment analysis module -- can you find substantial differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the `models.ldamodel` module from the [gensim library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html), run topic\n",
    "modeling over the corpus. Explore different numbers of topics (varying from 5 to 50), and settle for the parameter which\n",
    "returns topics that you consider to be meaningful at first sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *BONUS*: build the communication graph (unweighted and undirected) among the different email senders and recipients\n",
    "using the `NetworkX` library. Find communities in this graph with `community.best_partition(G)` method from the \n",
    "[community detection module](http://perso.crans.org/aynaud/communities/index.html). Print the most frequent 20 words used\n",
    "by the email authors of each community. Do these word lists look similar to what you've produced at step 3 with LDA?\n",
    "Can you identify clear discussion topics for each community? Discuss briefly the obtained results.\n"

      "These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"bumps in the road.\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.\n",
      "Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\n",

      "And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be\n",
      "pulled into the maelstrom.\n",
      "We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\n",
      "The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not\n",
      "through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\n",
      "trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\n",
      "But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"recovery\" that barely deserves the name. Our national\n",
      "debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\n",
      "Finally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\n",
      "By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\n",
      "He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\n",
      "The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\n",
      "grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\n",
      "weeks\n",
      "The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"daylight\" between our two\n",
      "countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"closest ally\" in the Middle East to being only \"one of our closest allies.\" It's a diplomatic message that will\n",
      "be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \"noise\" that he prefers to \"block out.\" And at a time when\n",
      "Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n",
      "In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who\n",
      "share our values.\n",
      "This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,\n",
      "the ayatollahs must be made to believe us.\n",
      "It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for\n",
      "those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to\n",
      "extremism.\n",
      "But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of\n",

      "In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a\n",
      "leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in\n",
      "Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was \"soft on communism,\" and he launched an\n",
      "investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his\n",
      "day.\n",
      "Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's\n",
      "and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having\n",
      "done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more\n",
      "at work.\n",
      "At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his\n",
      "Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn\n",
      "charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n",
      "She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.\n",
      "But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were\n",
      "wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.\n",
      "Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It\n",
      "was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a\n",

      "\"Yes,\" Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student\n",
      "snatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how\n",
      "corrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of\n",
      "the room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.\n",
      "\"Please sit,\" Adams tells the student.\n",

      "\"Historical change is like a revolution,\" Ashawntea says.\n",
      "Adams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President\n",
      "Obama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.\n",
      "\"Obama's campaign was all about change,\" Adams says. \"Do you think he is talking historical change?\" He\n",
      "wants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first\n",
      "100 days look like? he asks the students. \"What advice would you offer him?\"\n",
      "Carleto looks stumped.\n",
      "\"Just throw out some ideas,\" Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters\n",
      "to the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.\n",
      "Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. \"Obama's not reading our letters,\" he says. He folds his arms across\n",
      "his chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really\n",
      "want to hear his ideas.\n",
      "***\n",
      "Later, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's\n",
      "\"Dreams From My Father.\" \"It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,\" he says. He struggles hard to\n",
      "articulate the book's themes and appeal. \"I don't know how to put it,\" he says finally, \"but growing up with -- no\n",
      "disrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.\"\n",
      "Sitting in a guard's room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing\n",
      "basketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.\n",
      "\"As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was\n",
      "on the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,\" he says, beginning in third person, but quickly\n",
      "lapsing into first. \"In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing\n",
      "stuff I wasn't supposed to be doing.\"\n",
      "He takes full responsibility. \"No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was\n",
      "high,\" he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says\n",
      "that his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in \"a neighborhood thing.\" \"Nowadays,\n",
      "anyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,\" he says, explaining that\n",
      "his buddy was shot because of a \"miscommunication.\" \"It wasn't intended for us,\" he says, insisting that he and\n",
      "his friend, nicknamed \"Smoke,\" were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, \"I don't want to talk about\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "So he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle \"R.I.P. Smoke\" on the cover of his blue folder or on\n",
      "a piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.\n",
      "He's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.\n",
      "(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)\n",
      "Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that\n",
      "the classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is\n",
      "getting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in\n",
      "two months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says\n",
      "he will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,\n",
      "he intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to \"the Adidas shop in Georgetown,\n",
      "where my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.\"\n",
      "He says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. \"She was. . . I'm going to say she\n",
      "was kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,\" Carleto says. \"You know how they say 'Whatever hides\n",
      "in the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me.\" Meanwhile, she makes the\n",
      "long, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. \"Every weekend, both days!\" he says.\n",
      "He is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16\n",
      "and 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a\n",
      "secretary, but he struggles to remember where. \"She was working with, what's that program downtown by the\n",
      "Washington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the Holocaust\n",
      "Museum. It's a brick building. She works there.\"\n",
      "Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto's life.\n",
      "Although Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.\n",
      "And it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.\n",
      "Carleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to\n",
      "Oak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested\n",
      "repeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as\n",
      "prostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for\n",
      "assault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.\n",
      "She is not visiting Carleto on weekends.\n",
      "***\n",
      "By the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,\n",
      "jostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they\n",
      "take their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison\n",
      "yard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.\n",
      "Today, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color\n",
      "are 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is\n",
      "disproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on\n",
      "the desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, \"Racism of the Juvenile Justice System\n",
      "Revealed,\" to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: \"African-American\n",
      "youths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for\n",
      "identical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally\n",
      "charged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar\n",
      "break.\"\n",
      "Although youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721\n",
      "juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,\n",
      "disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee\n",
      "tries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.\n",
      "Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. \"Hey,\" he says, suddenly sitting forward.\n",
      "\"They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though\n",
      "there's more of them.\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Fee says. \"So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.\"\n",
      "Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.\n",
      "Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons\n",
      "behind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from\n",
      "different perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. \"So, we're going to have\n",
      "three roles,\" Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. \"One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math\n",
      "teacher; and one group is playing a city council member.\"\n",
      "Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on\n",
      "reforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. He doesn't even want to be\n",
      "here today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes\n",
      "them off.\n",
      "\"How could you maintain better relationships\" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto\n",
      "and his partner work through this.\n",
      "Carleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen\n",
      "challenge. \"Stop harassing people for no reason?\"\n",
      "\"How do you want them to treat people?\"\n",
      "\"Equally,\" he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more\n",
      "specific.\n",
      "\"Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing,\" Carleto's\n",
      "partner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.\n",
      "\"And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?\" Fee prods.\n",
      "A long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher before\n",
      "enrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.\n",
      "\"Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,\" Carleto says.\n",
      "\"Patrol each ward equally?\" asks Fee.\n",
      "Carleto writes that down, then adds: \"I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right.\" Fee nods, encourages\n",
      "him to write it down.\n",
      "Carleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. \"The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I could\n",
      "say, 'The majority of police are racist.'\"\n",
      "\"But how would you fix that?\" Fee. prods.\n",
      "\"A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one,\" Carleto suggests. He sits up\n",
      "straighter in his chair. \"And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's the\n",
      "reason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever.\" Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and\n",
      "he rattles off a list of improvements.\n",
      "\"Call to order of the city council,\" says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.\n",
      "Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. \"Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,\"\n",
      "Carleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. \"We have some\n",
      "complaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about\n",
      "cracking down on officers.\" He sounds nervous as he begins the list. \"Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic\n",
      "youths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at the\n",
      "school like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why\n",
      "this happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police.\" He moves briskly through the\n",
      "suggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,\n",
      "\"verbally abusing\" youth won't be tolerated any more. \"Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and\n",
      "have them removed, if so.\"\n",
      "Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's\n",
      "walkie-talkie. \"Time to go!\" the guard announces.\n",
      "The law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.\n",
      "\"Wait!\" Ashawntea says, standing up. \"We got 10 more minutes.\"\n",
      "\"It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,\" the guard says.\n",
      "\"But we have 10 minutes!\" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. \"It's only 2:20.\n",
      "We got 10 more minutes still.\"\n",
      "The guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. He goes back out into the hall to wait.\n",
      "Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked.\n",
      "\"Yesss!\" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.\n",

      "Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a one-day visit, delivering an American show of support for Iraq as it battles a\n",
      "sudden eruption of violence, in the wake of suicide bombings that killed at least 140 people and wounded several\n",
      "hundred more on Thursday and Friday.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton, in her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, acknowledged that the attacks were worrisome. She said\n",
      "she would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her first\n",
      "meeting on Saturday, a day packed with appointments.\n",
      "But she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsed\n",
      "Iraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail the\n",
      "progress the country has made in the last two years.\n",
      "\"In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts,\" Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannounced\n",
      "visit Friday evening. \"But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track.\"\n",
      "She characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of \"rejectionists\" who fear that the government will\n",
      "succeed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are \"in an unfortunately tragic way, a\n",
      "signal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.\"\n",
      "\"Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are,\" Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, \"If you look at the evidence,\n",
      "overwhelmingly the progress that's been made has been positive.\"\n",

      "Mrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted to\n",
      "authorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, though\n",
      "the attacks have cast a shadow over her visit.\n",
      "While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist and\n",
      "jihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the\n",
      "withdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that occurred several months after\n",
      "the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.\n",
      "At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald\n",
      "Rumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its\n",
      "\"last throes,\" while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of \"dead-enders\" who kept fighting a lost cause.\n",
      "On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a House appropriations\n",
      "committee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he\n",
      "said, were from Tunisia.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: \"We've seen suicide bombers from\n",
      "many countries in Iraq over the last six years. It's unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman,\n",
      "would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.\"\n",

      "The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was\n",
      "scheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-\n",
      "Maliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.\n",
      "She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to\n",
      "hold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial\n",

      "As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama scoffed at Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal to require people to\n",
      "buy health insurance.\n",
      "\"(If) they can't afford it, they just don't get it,\" Obama said during the primary, arguing that a mandate would\n",
      "not work unless insurance costs were lowered first.\n",
      "For the first time, Obama confirmed Wednesday that he plans to stake out a different position as president.\n",
      "In a letter to two leading Democratic senators, Obama said he could support a mandate on individuals to buy\n",
      "coverage, as long as Congress exempted those who could not afford it. This marks a shift from his stance during\n",
      "the campaign, when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate, and\n",
      "he did not.\n",
      "\"I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs,\n",
      "and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility,\" Obama wrote. \"But I believe if we are going to make\n",
      "people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable.\"\n",
      "\"If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a\n",
      "hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it,\" Obama wrote.\n",
      "Detailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president, Obama also said\n",
      "Americans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health care\n",
      "system.\n",
      "\"I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating\n",
      "alongside private plans,\" he wrote. \"This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market\n",
      "more competitive, and keep insurance companies honest.\"\n",
      "He offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government.\n",
      "Employers \"have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees,\" Obama wrote, but small\n",
      "businesses should be exempt.\n",
      "Obama's positions on these issues were not entirely surprising, but his decision to weigh in before\n",
      "congressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter, Obama and his aides\n",
      "had declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues, including the public plan and individual\n",
      "mandate, saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill.\n",
      "But Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance, and the letter provides the\n",

      "global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and\n",
      "political stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective\n",

      "The speech could be framed as follows:\n",
      "THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER\n",
      "You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable\n",
      "story: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and\n",
      "developed strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which\n",
      "devastates crops across Africa.\n",
      "Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify,\n",
      "and market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And\n",
      "he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.\n",
      "A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE\n",
      "Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one\n",
      "that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor\n",
      "to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where\n",
      "people get the nourishment they need to thrive.\n",
      "In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will\n",
      "go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and\n",
      "students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when\n",
      "food is scarce, political stability is threatened.\n",
      "44\n",
      "To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it\n",
      "is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.\n",
      "The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the\n",
      "creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural\n",
      "productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.\n",
      "We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual\n",
      "strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\n",
      "Plan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments,\n",
      "multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.\n",
      "THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH\n",
      "We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.\n",
      "• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to\n",
      "purchase them, and the training to use them.\n",
      "• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving\n",
      "transportation to connect small farmers to markets.\n",
      "• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right\n",
      "adaptations for the changing environment.\n",
      "• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture\n",
      "scientists.\n",
      "• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.\n",
      "• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and\n",
      "predictable policy and regulatory environment.\n",
      "• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but\n",
      "most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for\n",
      "agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.\n",
      "A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME\n",
      "In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to\n",
      "global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who\n",
      "have been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the\n",
      "private sector. The President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our\n",

      "• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer,\n",
      "irrigation, the credit to purchase them, and the training to use them.\n",
      "• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and\n",

      "• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of\n",

      "wide.\n",
      "• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in\n",
      "a clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment.\n",
      "• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are\n",
      "women, but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men.\n",
      "This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to\n",

      "In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our\n",
      "approach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom\n",

      "Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column,\n",
      "\"The Settlements Myth,\" is one example.\n",
      "Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the \"road map\" for peace,\n",
      "which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: \"GO! [Government of Israel] immediately\n",
      "dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all\n",
      "settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).\"\n",
      "Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime\n",
      "Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's\n",
      "April 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security\n",
      "adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing\n",
      "Israeli building within the \"construction line\" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such\n",
      "understanding.\n",
      "The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that\n",
      "construction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.\n",
      "The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building\n",
      "only inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the\n",
      "built-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of\n",
      "these provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.\n",
      "Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which\n",
      "Israel would retain \"existing major Israeli population centers\" in the West Bank \"on the basis of mutually\n",
      "agreed changes. . . .\" One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some\n",
      "settlements was predicated on there being an \"agreed outcome\" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that\n",
      "this letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush\n",
      "Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or\n",
      "other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.\n",
      "In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the \"construction line,\" saying that \"within the\n",
      "agreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition\n",
      "of the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria.\" However, there never were any \"agreed principles\n",
      "of settlement activities.\" Moreover, the effort to define the \"construction line\" was never consummated: Israel\n",
      "and the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of\n",
      "settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised \"continuous action\" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but\n",
      "Israel removed almost none of them.\n",
      "Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity.\n",
      "But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush\n",
      "administration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding\n",
      "continued settlement activity.\n",
      "Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the \"natural\n",
      "growth\" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this \"means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the\n",
      "1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies.\" This is nonsense. No one\n",
      "suggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to\n",
      "build more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like\n",
      "Americans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.\n",
      "The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,\n",
      "when Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.\n",
      "The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural\n",
      "increase of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of \"natural growth\" in official\n",
      "documents started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 \"road map,\" reflecting recognition that the\n",
      "concept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing\n",
      "policies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of\n",
      "achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians'\n",
      "responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.\n",

      "Is this another Iranian revolution?\n",
      "To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments\n",
      "in Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often\n",
      "marching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced\n",
      "determined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and\n",
      "ritual calls of \"Down with the shah!\"; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.\n",
      "You need only change \"shah\" to \"dictator,\" and you have a description of what is happening in Iran\n",
      "today.\n",
      "But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah\n",
      "Khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he\n",
      "represented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37\n",
      "years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On the\n",
      "surface it appeared to be an uneven battle — guns against turbans — but the ruler with the guns wavered\n",
      "and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.\n",
      "Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is\n",
      "notably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, Ayatollah\n",
      "IChamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his\n",
      "religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system\n",
      "and the institutions most loyal to him — particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful\n",
      "security forces, including the Revolutionary Guards.\n",
      "Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. The\n",
      "fraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented\n",
      "demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by\n",
      "the regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people\n",
      "stay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter of\n",
      "former president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then \"ordered\" everyone to\n",
      "march the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).\n",
      "IChamene'i announced the \"divine assessment\" of the election outcome — even before it would probably\n",
      "have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests,\n",
      "he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council— the same organization that was\n",
      "responsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no one\n",
      "expected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace and\n",
      "reconciliation. No one paid any attention.\n",
      "I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his \"victory,\" he went off\n",
      "to a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive\n",
      "player than a major actor in these events.\n",
      "So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that is\n",
      "probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.\n",
      "On the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made\n",
      "by the ultra-conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards, whose political role has ballooned over\n",
      "the past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterly\n",
      "ruthless and ideologically fueled.\n",
      "New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on June 15 below)\n",
      "at the end of the day, as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago, when Might and Right do battle, it's often prudent\n",
      "to bet on Might, at least in the short run.\n",
      "The regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup — the\n",
      "announcement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force — would intimidate and silence the\n",
      "opposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being\n",
      "made by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms, rather than politicians such as\n",
      "IChamene'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event, it b ackfired and they now have a\n",
      "much larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slim\n",
      "margin (which was at least believable).\n",
      "All parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to have\n",
      "concluded that their social contract with the rulers — accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectful\n",
      "regard for the opinion of the governed, an Islamic Republic — is no longer valid. They do not trust their\n",
      "rulers.\n",
      "The rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the\n",
      "country, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have called\n",
      "that tactic into question. For the military, the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear to\n",
      "be a moment to bet on Might.\n",
      "But nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could\n",
      "determine the future path of the Iranian revolution.\n",
      "There is another lesson as Iran's leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmen\n",

      "He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that \"Islamic government\n",

      "for realization of republicanism,\" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.\n",

      "Voters still don't know what Labour and Gordon Brown stand for, David Miliband admits today, as he reveals\n",
      "how close he came to quitting the government during last week's turmoil at Westminster.\n",
      "Speaking to the Guardian at the end of 10 extraordinary days, the foreign secretary says the party's high\n",
      "command was given an \"electric shock\" by the disastrous European election results, and he urges fellow\n",
      "ministers to get out and prepare for \"the fight of our life\".\n",
      "But Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally James Purnell, who resigned\n",
      "from the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down.\n",
      "Miliband said: \"I'd made my decision on Thursday. Sometimes you can make your decisions with great\n",
      "planning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly. James made his decision\n",
      "in good faith, I made my decision in good faith ... we all have tolive with our decisions.\"\n",
      "The Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader, he said. \"This divides people who are close and\n",
      "people feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way.\"\n",
      "Describing the task now facing Labour, he says: \"It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of 11\n",
      "months until the next general election, that we got 15% of the vote nationally [last week], that we came second\n",
      "in Wales and that one in 20 people voted for us. If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs to\n",

      "don't deserve a landslide' — then nothing will.\"\n",

      "But the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motives\n",
      "being questioned by anyone in Downing Street.\n",
      "Miliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision, saying: \"We need the message to go out\n",
      "that we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong.\n",
      "\"It is not a masochism strategy. It is about saying what we believe in. It is about clarity, priority, adding up to\n",

      "to get out there.\"\n",
      "Asked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown, Miliband said: \"He himself has said he has to\n",
      "build on his strengths and work on his weaknesses. That is a good maxim for all of us. He is someone who\n",
      "made the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day. We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignity\n",
      "for what we believe in. The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump into very dangerous\n",

      "\"I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed,\" Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.\n",
      "\"I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and\n",

      "Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial\n",

      "like Kenya and Congo.\n",
      "Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron\n",

      "up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed\n",
      "information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of\n",
      "things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and\n",
      "much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as \"and this day, and the next day\" as My Life,\n",
      "it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that\n",
      "there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,\n",
      "WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC\n",
      "quotes was far fewer than I had expected.\n",
      "HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with\n",
      "Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the\n",
      "Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought\n",
      "that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much\n",
      "aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in\n",
      "the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...\n",
      "Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion\n",
      "of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his\n",
      "connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are\n",
      "strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not\n",
      "appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,\n",
      "one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages\n",
      "about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you\n",
      "would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his\n",
      "chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.\n",
      "The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch\n",
      "could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,\n",
      "later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does\n",
      "portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks\n",
      "Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from\n",
      "Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such\n",
      "as WJC referring to Paula Jones as \"a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.\"\n",
      "Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no\n",
      "other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason\n",
      "he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if\n",
      "she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a\n",
      "very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this\n",
      "before. (This is addressed more fully below.)\n",
      "There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship\n",
      "with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with\n",
      "Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues\n",
      "are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed\n",
      "in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her\n",
      "relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.\n",
      "On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,\n",
      "China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about\n",

      "legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life\n",
      "counseling. How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,\n",
      "including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about \"death panels.\" As a result of these\n",
      "attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress\n",
      "have abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.\n",
      "Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and\n",
      "the misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother\n",

      "advances in, pain management.\n",
      "Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her\n",

      "anticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and\n",
      "exercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.\n",
      "When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully\n",

      "nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with\n",
      "friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.\n",
      "These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling\n",

      "reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the\n",
      "heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she\n",

      "striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign\n",
      "indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian\n",
      "idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem\n",
      "indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.\n",

      "departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy\n",
      "— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the\n",

      "tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,\n",
      "Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems\n",

      "Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking\n",

      "Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and\n",

      "imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.\n",
      "Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's\n",
      "coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily\n",

      "of the most liberal President in American History last year.\n",

      "There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is\n",

      "Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in\n",

      "But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of\n",
      "the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic\n",
      "coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.\n",
      "The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:\n",
      "Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began\n",
      "breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and\n",
      "liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.\n",
      "But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,\n",
      "urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a\n",
      "moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a\n",
      "combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation\n",
      "for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the\n",
      "Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by\n",
      "eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.\n",
      "Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call\n",
      "someone \"macaca,\" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,\n",
      "and are fans of \"law and order.\" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean\n",
      "environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced\n",
      "budgets are the ultimate \"good government\" indicator for these voters.\n",
      "Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.\n",
      "In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic\n",
      "growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the \"Carter\" label for the Democrats. This,\n",
      "in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -\n",
      "one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.\n",
      "George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,\n",
      "a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more\n",
      "heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,\n",
      "major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put\n",
      "together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.\n",
      "The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.\n",
      "But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the\n",
      "stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama\n",
      "received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.\n",
      "Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the\n",
      "remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with\n",
      "vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were\n",
      "enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black\n",
      "President.\n",
      "But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,\n",
      "poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the\n",
      "party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the\n",
      "door, the party isn't left with much.\n",
      "We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at\n",
      "the counties that Mark Warner won.\n",
      "The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the\n",
      "mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites\n",
      "in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,\n",
      "but it worked.\n",
      "Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:\n",
      "The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area\n",
      "becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,\n",
      "and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in\n",
      "during the 1920s.\n",
      "As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than\n",
      "Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the\n",
      "Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at\n",
      "least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia\n",
      "changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:\n",
      "The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward\n",
      "Democrats.\n",
      "We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC\n",
      "suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton\n",
      "Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in\n",
      "2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the\n",
      "ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.\n",
      "We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's\n",
      "compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at \"relative movement.\" Because\n",
      "everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing \"movement\" would be solid dark red, and not of\n",
      "much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved\n",
      "less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].\n",
      "We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't\n",
      "moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern\n",
      "portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This\n",
      "suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.\n",
      "Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so\n",
      "dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at \"relative\" shifts.\n",
      "The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans\n",
      "around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, \"blue\" in a relative map still\n",
      "means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in\n",
      "the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.\n",
      "In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to\n",
      "win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the\n",
      "Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.\n",
      "This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is\n",
      "very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to\n",
      "make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion\n",
      "dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade\n",
      "make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at\n",
      "some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first\n",
      "year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to\n",
      "enact a net spending cut any more.\n",
      "Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the\n",
      "mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out\n",
      "when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death\n",
      "penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18\n",
      "points, even holding everything else equal.\n",
      "The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in\n",
      "the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs\n",
      "voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like\n",
      "it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd\n",
      "Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative\n",
      "Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the\n",
      "outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures\n",
      "prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive\n",
      "there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen\n",
      "his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.\n",
      "States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved\n",
      "much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and\n",
      "Senator, in classic \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of\n",
      "course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.\n",
      "This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other\n",
      "factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls\n",

      "show its downside for downticket Democrats.\n",

      "reason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China\n",
      "reduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater\n",

      "China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to\n",
      "finance its budget deficits.\n",
      "If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official\n",
      "reserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its\n",
      "purchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.\n",
      "In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.\n",
      "dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an\n",
      "appreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by\n",
      "China's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh\n",
      "the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.\n",
      "Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other\n",
      "major currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest\n",
      "rates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S.\n",
      "Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market\n",
      "disruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a\n",
      "substantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are\n",
      "very unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative\n",
      "official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.\n",
      "Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods\n",
      "This is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of\n",
      "manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,\n",
      "etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute\n",
      "for products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among\n",
      "producers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are\n",
      "narrowing.\n",

      "objective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.\n",
      "Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.\n",
      "The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.\n",
      "The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While\n",
      "no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there\n",
      "is less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo\n",
      "because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in\n",
      "China's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to\n",

      "Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to\n",
      "be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.\n",
      "Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for China\n",
      "Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects\n",
      "on China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes\n",
      "in China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been\n",
      "a major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve\n",

      "But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and\n",
      "reassign the pieces?\n",
      "There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its \"core missions\" of\n",
      "traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found\n",
      "that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a\n",
      "bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,\n",
      "the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including\n",
      "\"today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria,\" the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like the\n",
      "International Atomic Energy Agency.\n",

      "in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers\n",
      "capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.\n",
      "By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on\n",

      "now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for\n",
      "example, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the State\n",

      "Further, rivalries between the different \"cones\" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the \"conal caste system\"\n",
      "-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau\n",
      "noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a \"failed office\" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.\n",
      "Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership \"does not understand public diplomacy.\" The sentiment is\n",
      "widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,\n",
      "described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional\n",
      "discrimination against those in the career track.\n",
      "Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human\n",
      "and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its\n",
      "bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike\n",
      "Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is\n",
      "so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If\n",
      "there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean\n",
      "it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.\n",
      "The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such\n",
      "luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the \"expanding\n",

      "diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --\n",
      "could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.\n",

      "and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to\n",

      "regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.\n",
      "Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would\n",

      "A hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened \"A Tale of Two Cities\" with the now-famous phrase:\n",
      "\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ...\"\n",
      "Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks in\n",
      "America. So far, it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the first\n",
      "black president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racial\n",
      "tensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it.\n",
      "Last year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst for\n",
      "an era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria of\n",
      "hope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, they've\n",
      "gotten worse.\n",
      "The recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.\n",
      "A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-priced\n",
      "subprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group with\n",
      "the lowest homeownership rates.\n",
      "According to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites,\n",
      "the gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate\n",
      "over that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts,\n",
      "the rate grew by about twice that much.\n",
      "And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, \"food insecurity\" for\n",
      "American households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that\n",
      "food insecurity.\n",
      "Things on the racial front are just as bad.\n",
      "We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester\n",
      "with a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially\n",
      "offensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results\n",
      "of image searches of them.\n",
      "And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008\n",
      "hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate\n",
      "crimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would\n",
      "include Obarna's ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the\n",
      "other racial groups have fallen 19 percent.\n",
      "This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent of\n",
      "blacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half that\n",
      "percentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.\n",
      "The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among\n",
      "blacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites has dropped\n",
      "to 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.\n",
      "Also, this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for\n",

      "\"Precious,\" features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president\n",
      "feels like a nice counterbalance.\n",
      "However, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama's\n",
      "enemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their\n",
      "voices would have presumably held greater sway.\n",
      "This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to\n",
      "African-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In\n",
      "the Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts\n",
      "to aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.\n",
      "The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.\n",
      "According to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama\n",
      "would still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able\n",
      "to accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.\n",
      "In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.\n",
      "In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month,\n",

      "lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those\n",
      "terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate\n",

      "The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the\n",
      "Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in\n",
      "strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to \"live, eat and train\n",
      "together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other\n",
      "accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success.\" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan\n",
      "security forces \"is our goal.\"\n",
      "To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts\n",
      "to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat\n",
      "forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan\n",
      "Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than\n",
      "presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban\n",
      "fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.\n",
      "While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people\n",
      "hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly\n",
      "motivated and its troops are proven fighters.\n",
      "Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to\n",
      "regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the\n",
      "perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,\n",
      "al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-\n",
      "level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.\n",
      "I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that\n",
      "Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.\n",
      "First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are\n",
      "approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of\n",
      "2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have\n",
      "urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of\n",
      "Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are\n",
      "prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and\n",
      "essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.\n",
      "Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand\n",
      "province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in\n",
      "Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops \"is absolutely our Achilles heel.\"\n",
      "What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister\n",
      "Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.\n",
      "But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train\n",
      "Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would\n",
      "be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much\n",
      "greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces\n",
      "they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.\n",
      "Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to\n",
      "graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister\n",
      "Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.\n",
      "Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in\n",
      "the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group\n",
      "of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available\n",
      "infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.\n",
      "Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant\n",
      "amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to\n",
      "equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create\n",
      "momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling\n",
      "it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the\n",
      "Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that\n",
      "kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the\n",
      "Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.\n",
      "Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now\n",
      "face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in\n",
      "capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a\n",
      "year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a\n",
      "major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies\n",
      "can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a\n",
      "Muslim nation.\n",
      "Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of\n",
      "young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the \"Sons of Iraq.\" They were drawn in\n",
      "part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating\n",
      "horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides\n",
      "and became a positive force.\n",
      "That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated\n",
      "largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They\n",
      "believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for\n",
      "themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.\n",
      "General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was\n",
      "achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:\n",
      "\"Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are\n",
      "deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic\n",
      "leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call\n",
      "mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.\"\n",
      "But this \"game changing\" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan\n",
      "yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to\n",
      "involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our\n",
      "Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken\n",
      "into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.\n",
      "Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in\n",
      "Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or\n",
      "so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the\n",
      "United States should stay, one elder said: \"Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you\n",
      "will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.\"\n",
      "Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of\n",
      "opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.\n",
      "Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the\n",
      "initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency\n",
      "headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?\n",
      "I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more\n",
      "quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the\n",

      "with a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entity\n",
      "makes a lot of sense.\n",
      "Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% of\n",
      "the population.\n",
      "Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment\n",
      "and accentuate political instability.\n",
      "Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth are a wellspring\n",
      "of creativity, talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they are\n",
      "stifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.\n",
      "Fortunately, Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitution\n",
      "commits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many Haitian and\n",
      "international organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.\n",
      "A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.\n",
      "They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields and\n",
      "providing services in Haiti's countryside.\n",
      "At a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.\n",
      "This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were out\n",
      "of work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their\n",
      "and their country's pride and dignity.\n",
      "A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next\n",
      "crisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing\n",
      "monumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapid\n",
      "disbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring\n",
      "capital.\n",
      "Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the\n",
      "bottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct\n",
      "monetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalistic\n",
      "programs that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumvent\n",
      "unnecessary administrative costs.\n",
      "Further, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During past\n",
      "decades, the state provided relatively few services to Haitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, state\n",
      "entities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap.\n",
      "A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the\n",
      "government's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It would\n",
      "be a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.\n",
      "A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path of\n",
      "hurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women\n",
      "-- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the\n",
      "consequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensive\n",
      "training in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health.\n",
      "An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti,\n",
      "including the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable\n",
      "experiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental\n",
      "organization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and\n",
      "trained hundreds of Haitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. This\n",
      "program could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.\n",
      "A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years.\n",
      "The Haitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from the\n",
      "president's office and the Interior Ministry.\n",
      "And there are many countries that could provide advice and support.\n",
      "Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential\n",
      "skills.\n",
      "Haiti's youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scale\n",

      "CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would\n",
      "win. In today's information age, politics is also about whose \"story\" wins.\n",
      "National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other\n",
      "organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between\n",
      "the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played\n",
      "crucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China.\n",
      "Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a \"paradox of\n",
      "plenty.\" When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell\n",
      "may, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.\n",
      "For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British\n",
      "governments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya\n",
      "Kikwete's day: \"he rises at dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.\"\n",
      "Skeptics who treat the term \"public diplomacy\" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple\n",
      "propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations\n",
      "campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment\n",
      "for government policies.\n",
      "The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three\n",
      "dimensions or stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension\n",
      "is daily communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This\n",
      "dimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event,\n",
      "others will rush in to fill it.\n",
      "The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political\n",
      "or advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over\n",
      "weeks, months, and even years.\n",
      "The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over\n",
      "many years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to\n",
      "media channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the\n",
      "crucial \"last three feet\" — face-to-face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.\n",
      "But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it\n",
      "cuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public\n",
      "diplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried\n",
      "to enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown\n",
      "in Tibet — and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.\n",
      "Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not\n",
      "always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign\n",
      "policy undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy \"on steroids,\" staffed by diplomats trained in\n",
      "new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-\n",
      "represented groups.\n",
      "The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to\n",
      "correct daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message.\n",
      "The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness\n",
      "and set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different\n",
      "cultural settings. The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt\n",
      "to distort what is heard.\n",
      "Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-\n",
      "peer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for\n",
      "governments to accomplish, given their central accountability structures.\n",
      "The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call\n",
      "\"the new public diplomacy,\" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct\n",
      "governmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building\n",
      "relationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental\n",
      "parties at home and abroad.\n",
      "In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than\n",
      "controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can\n",
      "undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from\n",
      "one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.\n",
      "Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard\n",

      "Gelb sifts the fallout for clues.\n",
      "When you write that the president of the United States should replace his chief of staff, someone will fire back. So it was\n",
      "that Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back at my piece last week on the Daily Beast through a column in Sunday's\n",
      "Washington Post. Only this time, the return fire had a rare twist, one that could produce Washington convulsions. It was\n",
      "seemingly aimed at me (and others who published suggestions of Emanuel's limitations as chief). But whether it was\n",
      "intentional or not, the volley actually struck the president himself.\n",
      "Here is the story, a very Washington tale of stretching permissible criticism of power holders, of pungent media leaks, of\n",
      "labyrinthine speculation as to who is doing what to whom.\n",
      "Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a \"traitor\" to the boss.\n",
      "With a headline \"Replace Rahm,\" I wrote last Tuesday that Emanuel lacked the managerial skills, discipline, and strategic\n",
      "ability to get things done as chief of staff. I argued he should be moved over to a political adviser slot, where his\n",
      "considerable, can-do talents would better serve his boss. I targeted others as well, mostly in Mr. Obama's Chicago crowd.\n",
      "Several writers also blasted this crowd, mostly with unsigned bullets, but never crossed the red line calling for their\n",
      "removal. I wrote the piece because it essentially reflected the waves of anti-White House staff critiques breaking over\n",
      "Washington, but rarely heard outside its drawing rooms. I did it because I believed the president was running out of\n",
      "chances to succeed and needed better and tougher staffers. I did it because if he failed, the nation failed.\n",
      "Then came the inevitable blast back, a devastating leak, in a piece by Dana Milbank, a respected Washington journalist.\n",
      "Interesting that the leaker selected Milbank. He's sort of a half-reporter, half-columnist who roams the entire capital city,\n",
      "not just the White House. The leaker must have felt safe because Milbank has so many sources all over town, making the\n",
      "leakers harder to trace.\n",
      "The Milbank headline read: \"Why Obama needs Rahm at the top.\" It began: \"Let us now praise Rahm Emanuel. No,\n",
      "seriously.\" Then, he lists me and a couple others who also criticized Rahm. \"But,\" he continued, \"sacking Emanuel is the\n",
      "last thing the president should do.\"\n",
      "Then, Milbank (and presumably the leaker) delivered the surprise and wounding blow – to the president himself. \"Obama's\n",
      "first year fell apart in large part because he didn't follow his chief of staffs advice on crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel is\n",
      "the only person keeping Obama from becoming Jimmy Carter.\"\n",
      "Then, Milbank (and the leaker) took his first shot, not at me, but at congressional liberals and everyone in the Chicago\n",
      "crowd except Rahm. \"Obama's problem,\" Milbank continued, \"is that his other confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett and\n",
      "Robert Gibbs, and, to a lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part of the Cult of Obama. In love with the president, they\n",
      "believe he is a transformational figure who needn't dirty his hands in politics.\"\n",
      "So, it was \"their\" fault—until you see the real blow landed beyond them and on the President himself. \"The president\n",
      "would have been better off heeding Emanuel's counsel,\" but instead \"overruled\" him on several key Rahm\n",

      "By Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST\n",
      "Harry Reid isn't talkative. But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authors\n",
      "who came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election.\n",
      "They — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned a\n",
      "backbencher in his caucus into president of the United States.\n",
      "Reid wasn't on guard — perhaps because he'd been told by his staff that the meeting would be \"off the record,\"\n",
      "according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.\n",
      "Although Reid is a master of the Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched the outside game because of what\n",
      "one colleague calls a \"penchant for saying things without a filter.\"\n",
      "But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't too worried as he and his boss sat down with John\n",
      "Heilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working on\n",
      "what their publisher had billed as \"a sweeping, novelistic, and ultimately definitive portrait\" of the 2008 race.\n",
      "Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin, the longtime\n",
      "political director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with \"The Note.\"\n",
      "Maybe Reid and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed that\n",
      "Halperin wouldn't burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quotes\n",
      "he planned to use?\n",
      "Whatever they were thinking, they were wrong.\n",
      "Reid was talking about the reasons why, even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democratic\n",
      "primaries of 2008, he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of his\n",
      "caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama's oratorical gifts, he let slip something else:\n",
      "Obama could win the White House because he was a \"light-skinned\" African-American \"with no Negro dialect, unless he\n",
      "wanted to have one.\"\n",
      "The authors write in \"Game Change,\" published this weekend, that Reid had made the remark \"privately.\" They did not\n",
      "say he had said it to them.\n",
      "As a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support this\n",
      "weekend, he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors.\n",
      "In the book's\"Authors' Note,\" they wrote: \"All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with the\n",
      "candidates themselves — were conducted on a 'deep background' basis, which means we agreed not to identify the\n",
      "subjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sort\n",
      "depends.\"\n",
      "Heilemann said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\": \"We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviews\n",
      "would be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won't identify any of our sources as the sources of the\n",
      "material. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book, if they were uttering\n",
      "dialogue to people in the book in part of a scene, that we would identify them as the utterer of those words.\"\n",
      "Halperin added: \"There's no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way, or violated any agreement with.\"\n",
      "Manley, a Capitol Hill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, had been responsible for monitoring\n",
      "the interview and dealing with issues arising from it.\n",
      "But he didn't tell anyone else in Reid's inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of his\n",
      "good relationship with the authors, he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without his\n",
      "knowing about it first.\n",
      "Manley declined comment on this story-- and wouldn't confirm if the interview took place.\n",
      "On Friday at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff with\n",
      "questions about a \"light-skinned\" candidate without a \"Negro dialect.\"\n",
      "In the second-guessing that followed, Capitol Hill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from a\n",
      "Senate majority leader would remain off the record, even if that had been the arrangement.\n",
      "But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm, he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat-\n",
      "footed by Ambinder's e-mail, several people close to the situation told POLITICO.\n",
      "\"They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it,\" said a Democrat who\n",
      "participated in some of the damage control.\n",
      "Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that, if mishandled, could be politically fatal. Manley and other\n",
      "aides worked until 2 a.m. Saturday to draft Reid's carefully written apology, which emphasized his record on African-\n",
      "American issues.\n",

      "A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to\n",
      "former President Bill Clinton.\n",
      "Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to\n",
      "Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.\n",
      "But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the\n",
      "country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. \"It's not the right thing to do,\" he said,\n",
      "according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.\n",
      "A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been\n",

      "Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.\n",
      "Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of\n",
      "donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.\n",
      "Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York\n",
      "resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.\n",
      "A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in\n",
      "discussions of \"who got there first, and who meant it the most,\" on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a\n",
      "Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.\n",
      "What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,\n",
      "was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were\n",
      "few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.\n",
      "Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.\n",
      "As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford\n",
      "emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at\n",
      "Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.\n",
      "What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,\n",

      "Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of\n",
      "HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. \"I think you should give this serious thought,\" he said, of\n",
      "the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.\n",
      "After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea\n",
      "off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot at\n",
      "reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.\n",
      "Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connected\n",
      "executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States\n",
      "investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the\n",
      "founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.\n",

      "Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.\n",
      "\"She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up\" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,\n",
      "conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.\n",
      "As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be\n",
      "shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there\n",
      "were \"scared and desperate\" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her\n",
      "city.\n",
      "But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January,\n",
      "the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local\n",
      "lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to\n",
      "several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New\n",
      "York politics than Mr. Ford.\n",
      "\"With all due respect,\" he asked Mr. Ford, \"why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?\"\n",
      "Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand\n",
      "would be harder than it seemed.\n",
      "Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, \"It's\n",
      "difficult to make a strong case against her here.\" Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of\n",
      "federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his\n",
      "relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he\n",
      "encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.\n",
      "After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently\n",
      "pushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.\n",
      "It did not. \"He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up,\" a friend said.\n",
      "One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election,\n",
      "arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.\n",
      "Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by\n",
      "quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.\n",
      "Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman's\n",

      "Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut\n",
      "off financing for abortions. \"You gave her a pass,\" he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to\n",
      "run he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: \"We can never support you if you take\n",
      "these positions.\" Mr. Ford \"looked shocked,\" a person in the room said.\n",
      "His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the\n",

      "By PAUL KRUGMAN\n",
      "Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,\n",
      "undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done.\n",
      "To give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi\n",
      "and buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive — began\n",
      "around 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall\n",
      "surplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.\n",
      "Today, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary\n",
      "Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most\n",
      "distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.\n",
      "And it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquidity\n",
      "trap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are\n",
      "already near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these\n",
      "economies, which they can't offset.\n",
      "So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.\n",
      "Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that \"manipulate the rate of exchange between their\n",
      "currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining\n",
      "unfair competitive advantage in international trade.\" The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,\n",
      "not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling\n",
      "to do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or\n",
      "seven years pretending not to see the obvious.\n",
      "Will the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.\n",
      "If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:\n",
      "the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.\n",
      "What you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates\n",
      "soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're being kept near zero by the Fed, which won't raise rates\n",
      "until the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they're mainly determined by market\n",
      "expectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by\n",
      "expanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.\n",
      "It's true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the\n",
      "euro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce\n",
      "our trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar\n",
      "holdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.\n",
      "So we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?\n",
      "Some still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we've been reasoning with China for years, as\n",
      "its surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly —\n",
      "that his nation's currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the\n",
      "renminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually\n",
      "does, seeking to weaken their currencies \"just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.\"\n",
      "But if sweet reason won't work, what's the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe\n",
      "problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few\n",
      "months later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it's hard to\n",
      "see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would\n",
      "have to be much larger, say 25 percent.\n",
      "I don't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world's economic\n",

      "The administration's best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that\n",

      "agreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration\n",

      "In retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved\n",

      "Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive\n",
      "By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER\n",
      "Published: April 18, 2010\n",
      "WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White\n",
      "House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress\n",
      "toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.\n",
      "Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.\n",
      "James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to\n",
      "develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be\n",
      "considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.\n",
      "Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not\n",
      "sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.\n",
      "One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,\n",
      "described the document as \"a wake-up call.\" But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months\n",
      "they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.\n",
      "In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: \"On Iran, we are doing\n",
      "what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see\n",
      "doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.\"\n",
      "But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran\n",
      "choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it\n",
      "needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.\n",
      "In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a\n",
      "\"virtual\" nuclear weapons state.\n",
      "According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain\n",
      "Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be\n",
      "obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely\n",
      "possibility.\n",
      "Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the\n",
      "document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, \"The secretary believes the president and his national security\n",
      "team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of\n",
      "contingencies with respect to Iran.\"\n",
      "Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow.\n",
      "Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was\n",
      "a line Iran would not be permitted to cross.\n",
      "The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not \"acquire a nuclear capability,\" a step Tehran\n",
      "could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. \"That includes the ability to have a breakout,\" he said,\n",
      "using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its\n",
      "technology to build a small arsenal.\n",
      "Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a\n",
      "difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. \"I'm not going to parse that right\n",
      "now,\" he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,\n",
      "as he said, \"became a self-professed nuclear state.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps\n",
      "toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press,\" he said: \"If their policy is to go to\n",
      "the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know\n",
      "how you would verify that.\" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, \"It's going slow -\n",
      "slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to\n",
      "issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.\n",
      "Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United\n",
      "States was not adequately prepared.\n",
      "He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic\n",
      "engagement.\n",
      "Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that\n",
      "the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain\n",
      "near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in\n",
      "what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a\n",
      "medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.\n",
      "Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White\n",
      "House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,\n",
      "just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official\n",
      "\"chairman's guidance\" to his staff saying that while any military option would have \"limited results\" against Iran's\n",
      "nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.\n",
      "\"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,\" the admiral wrote.\n",
      "Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under\n",
      "way. So did General Jones. \"The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be\n",
      "prepared for every possible contingency,\" he said in the interview. \"That is what we have done from day one, while\n",
      "successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.\"\n",
      "At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense\n",

      "(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of\n",
      "Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM\n",
      "commander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-\n",
      "slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among\n",
      "Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losing\n",
      "faith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in\n",
      "the region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) \"too old, too slow ... and\n",
      "too late.\"\n",
      "The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on\n",
      "what is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed\n",
      "from a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus's instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.\n",
      "\"Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,\" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. \"America\n",
      "was not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding.\" But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days\n",
      "after the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with\n",
      "Israel, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reason\n",
      "was straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab\n",
      "leaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.\n",

      "might have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.\"\n",
      "(UCP means \"unified combatant command,\" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]\n",

      "used to the fact that PgIrack Obama runs the\n",
      "most centralised — or \"White House-centric\" —\n",

      "his national security adviser and secretary of\n",
      "state.\n",
      "In contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policy\n",
      "strategist. Even insiders give different answers\n",
      "when asked to whom he turns for advice on the\n",
      "big international questions. But almost all agree\n",
      "with the following observation. \"The truth is that\n",
      "President Obama is his own Henry Kissinger —\n",
      "no one else plays that role,\" says a senior official.\n",
      "\"Every administration reflects the personality of\n",
      "the president. This president wants all the trains\n",
      "Barack Obama at the Great Wall of China last year. Unlike his\n",
      "predecessor Richard Nixon, who turned to Henry Kissinger for\n",
      "advice, the US president has no big foreign policy strategist\n",
      "routed through the Oval Office.\"\n",
      "Fifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.\n",
      "But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to\n",
      "speak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a long\n",
      "time around, Mr Obama himself.\n",
      "Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the passage\n",
      "last week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself,\n",
      "his centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention, say\n",
      "critics.\n",
      "\"On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely,\" says the official. \"On the debit\n",
      "side, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't have\n",
      "much depth on some issues.'\n",
      "The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises\n",
      "the president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,\n",
      "military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many\n",
      "people's surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.\n",
      "Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little\n",
      "interest in running the \"inter-agency\" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels\n",
      "frequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National Security\n",
      "Council, known as the \"principals meeting\", not Gen Jones.\n",
      "Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. \"If you were to ask me who the real national security\n",
      "adviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rehm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least\n",
      "important,\" says another official.\n",
      "Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign\n",
      "governments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he\n",
      "does not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen\n",
      "Jones provoked laughter when he said: \"I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did\n",
      "what you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.\"\n",
      "The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-\n",
      "Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as his\n",
      "envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab\n",
      "confidence in the talks.\n",
      "In a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the ,Clvg\n",
      "li..0f7;ce. last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand, the\n",
      "only officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.\n",
      "Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.\n",
      "\"The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what the\n",
      "next step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?\" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration and\n",
      "former head of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?\"\n",
      "Mr Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy\n",
      "national security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent \"deputies' meetings\", which\n",
      "can sometimes consume four to six hours a day.\n",
      "Described by one insider as \"the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known\", Mr Donilon,\n",
      "who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there are\n",
      "a lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as \"clinically insane\" by a former\n",
      "senior diplomat under Bill Clinton.\n",
      "But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. \"People\n",
      "forget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush's\n",
      "two terms] in America's power and reputation in our history,\" says a senior official. \"It took time to put in place a process\n",
      "that could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.\"\n",
      "Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to\n",
      "prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to George\n",
      "Bush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of \"parallel\n",
      "process\" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.\n",
      "\"If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken, you cannot find it,\" says the\n",
      "senior official. \"By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions.\"\n",
      "The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,\n",
      "often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. Mr\n",
      "Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.\n",
      "All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US\n",
      "ambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton\n",
      "administration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: \"A lot of work gets done in that group,\" says\n",
      "Ms Flournoy. \"Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going.\"\n",
      "The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to\n",
      "send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval\n",
      "Office meetings.\n",
      "But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.\n",
      "\"Time is the most precious commodity a president has,\" says a former national security adviser. \"On average he is only\n",
      "going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent.\"\n",
      "The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.\n",
      "Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis\n",
      "McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are\n",
      "widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.\n",
      "Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's \"Lord High Executioner\", Mr McDonough \"has appended himself to the Chicago\n",
      "crowd\", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's\n",
      "foreign policy apparatus.\n",
      "Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side\n",
      "during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the \"enforcer\" and as the keeper of \"message discipline\", a key element of\n",
      "any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.\n",
      "\"McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,\" says\n",
      "an official. \"Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round.\"\n",
      "Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. \"Donilon has\n",
      "been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table,\" says David Rothkopf, a former\n",
      "Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. \"Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that\n",
      "was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited.\"\n",
      "Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level\n",
      "meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy,\n",
      "which continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.\n",
      "And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they are\n",
      "absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the rog,,g: witsirawal from anistan. in July 2011 — a\n",
      "recommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.\n",
      "On the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus\n",
      "side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.\n",
      "Bush.\n",
      "\"At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with a\n",
      "real lawyer's clarity,\" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. \"When\n",
      "the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.\"\n",

      "STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS\n",
      "An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle\n",
      "If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the\n",
      "alliance between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.\n",
      "Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working\n",
      "relationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson\n",
      "internationally — if not at home, where Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.\n",
      "Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the\n",
      "credibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a\n",
      "holdover from the Bush administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no\n",
      "coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.\n",
      "The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on\n",
      "Afghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.\n",
      "\"Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted,\" says one official, who notes\n",
      "that while the traditional role of the NSC is to \"play referee\" between the state and defence departments,\n",
      "it is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how\n",
      "it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.\n",
      "\"We work together well,\" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. \"I think it\n",
      "starts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that\n",
      "the secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.\"\n",
      "Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on\n",
      "diplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough\n",
      "sanctions; on Russia, both have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations\n",
      "with the Kremlin.\n",
      "But for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the\n",
      "Obama inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant \"residue of friction\"\n",
      "between Mr Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs\n",

      "response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by\n",

      "consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was\n",
      "presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.\n",
      "2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to\n",
      "six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for\n",
      "about 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through\n",
      "December 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.\n",
      "3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency\n",
      "infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore\n",
      "services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma\n",

      "telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.\n",

      "slightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and\n",
      "implementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be\n",
      "implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.\n",
      "6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have\n",
      "own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume\n",
      "fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that\n",
      "the funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-\n",

      "doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without\n",
      "appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight\n",

      "that they can have a chance to succeed,\" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before\n",
      "speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She\n",
      "says: \"The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it\n",
      "demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.\"\n",
      "Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome\n",

      "and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.\n",
      "The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama\n",
      "administration\n",
      "When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the\n",
      "obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne \"that's politics\". She adds: \"We're\n",
      "working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to\n",
      "me.\" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. \"I always run\n",
      "inclusive and successful organisations,\" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from\n",
      "that searing experience to her new post.\n",

      "Senate -. \"but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do\n",
      "something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't.\" Also, she adds: \"Suppose I had won\n",
      "and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.\"\n",
      "Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton\n",
      "has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than\n",
      "before. \"Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised\n",
      "that,\" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. \"The relationship is\n",
      "based on her performance in the job.\"\n",
      "By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good\n",
      "working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an\n",
      "alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is\n",
      "Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been\n",
      "popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -\n",
      "as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.\n",
      "In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's\n",
      "Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he\n",
      "is to hint at using the military. \"She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,\" says Kurt\n",

      "She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of\n",
      "Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.\n",
      "Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides\n",
      "say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill\n",
      "Clinton gives her strategic advice. \"One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a\n",
      "kind of baseball saying,\" she says: \"Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines\n",
      "but the trend lines.\"\n",
      "It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the\n",
      "chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,\n",
      "she replies \"the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying\n",
      "and solving problems.\" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.\n",
      "But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,\n",
      "when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable\n",
      "are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but\n",
      "needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a\n",
      "smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had\n",
      "towards her.\n",
      "\"It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the\n",
      "most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,\" says one official. Praising what he\n",
      "calls her \"Terminator-quality durability and determination,\" he adds: \"She's done an amazing amount of\n",
      "work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.\"\n",
      "Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She\n",
      "has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her\n",
      "confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the\n",
      "meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She\n",
      "herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her\n",
      "campaign claims of expertise in the field. \"It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around\n",
      "all of these issues,\" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the\n",
      "way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze\n",
      "a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, \"you may be in a different city\n",
      "four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your\n",
      "audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global\n",
      "challenges in the course of a day.\"\n",
      "As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of\n",
      "international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of\n",
      "important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,\n",
      "Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She\n",
      "says the push is working, hailing a \"change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the\n",
      "US\" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and\n",
      "over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid\n",
      "questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.\n",
      "During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the\n",
      "country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to\n",
      "secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her\n",
      "cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign\n",
      "minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces \"an Iran that runs to\n",
      "Brazil\" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China \"telling different things to different people to\n",
      "avoid international sanctions\". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions\n",
      "on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. \"Of course, I don't agree\n",
      "with everything the Secretary said,\" he says.\n",
      "It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the\n",
      "United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers\n",
      "described his approach to government as a \"permanent campaign\", and it appears to be his wife's\n",
      "preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in\n",
      "her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.\n",
      "\"Never, never!\" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the\n",
      "frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. \"I have a very realistic sense of what high-\n",

      "arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,\n",

      "in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama\n",

      "fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the\n",
      "enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a\n",
      "process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially\n",

      "Nicknamed \"COINdinistas\" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution\n",
      "for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.\n",
      "As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists\n",
      "in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.\n",
      "After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary\n",

      "critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. \"The idea that we are going to spend a trillion\n",

      "In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the\n",
      "president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic\n",
      "crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.\n",
      "Then, without ever using the words \"victory\" or \"win,\" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops\n",

      "of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.\n",
      "troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that\n",
      "began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it\n",
      "as a \"bleeding ulcer.\" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and\n",
      "Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The\n",

      "didn't want.\n",
      "Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to\n",

      "There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two\n",
      "fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as\n",
      "Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves\n",
      "on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about\n",
      "changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had\n",
      "taken to deriding ISAF as short for \"I Suck at Fighting\" or \"In Sandals and Flip-Flops.\") McChrystal banned alcohol on\n",
      "base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands\n",
      "of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub\n",
      "modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary\n",
      "for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend\n",

      "McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. \"All these men,\" he tells me. \"I'd die for them. And they'd die\n",
      "for me.\"\n",
      "The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group\n",
      "represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable\n",
      "command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an\n",

      "Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into\n",
      "the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call\n",
      "the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. \"It jeopardizes the mission,\"\n",
      "says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. \"The military cannot\n",
      "by itself create governance reform.\"\n",
      "Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State\n",
      "Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit\n",
      "about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and\n",
      "veteran of the Cold War, a \"clown\" who remains \"stuck in 1985.\" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,\n",
      "\"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk\n",
      "shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful.\" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. \"Hillary\n",
      "had Stan's back during the strategic review,\" says an adviser. \"She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'\"\n",
      "McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. \"The Boss says\n",
      "he's like a wounded animal,\" says a member of the general's team. \"Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to\n",
      "get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp\n",
      "onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.\"\n",
      "At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. \"Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,\" he groans. \"I\n",
      "don't even want to open it.\" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in\n",
      "his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.\n",
      "\"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,\" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.\n",
      "By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.\n",
      "According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and\n",
      "2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by\n",
      "NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the\n",
      "diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively\n",
      "increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. \"In reality, that position needs to be filled\n",
      "by an American for it to have weight,\" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.\n",
      "The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New\n",
      "York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's\n",
      "strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as \"not an adequate strategic partner,\" and cast doubt on whether the\n",
      "counterinsurgency plan would be \"sufficient\" to deal with Al Qaeda. \"We will become more deeply engaged here with no\n",
      "way to extricate ourselves,\" Eikenberry warned, \"short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and\n",
      "chaos.\"\n",
      "McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. \"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said\n",
      "anything like that to us before,\" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt \"betrayed\" by the leak. \"Here's one that covers his\n",
      "flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'\"\n",
      "The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not\n",
      "diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead\n",
      "Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered\n",
      "credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied\n",
      "the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.\n",
      "In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get\n",
      "him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the\n",
      "president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted\n",
      "the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.\n",
      "This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government\n",
      "puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his\n",
      "cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. \"He's been locked up in his\n",
      "palace the past year,\" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined\n",
      "McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.\n",
      "soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. \"General,\" he called out to McChrystal, \"I didn't even know we were\n",
      "fighting in Uruzgan!\"\n",
      "Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him\n",
      "throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all\n",
      "joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he\n",
      "made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a\n",
      "fastball down the middle.\n",
      "McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the\n",
      "last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The \"Prison on the Hudson,\" as it was known then, was a\n",
      "potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,\n",
      "and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called \"rat fucking,\" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or\n",
      "mud, covered in shaving cream. \"It was pretty out of control,\" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to\n",
      "serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls \"huge talent\" and\n",
      "\"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,\" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.\n",
      "forces in Iraq.\n",
      "The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to\n",
      "thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more\n",
      "than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a\n",
      "\"century man.\" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after\n",
      "downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours\n",
      "subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. \"I'd come visit, and I'd\n",
      "end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,\" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal\n",
      "in 1973.\n",
      "McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as\n",
      "brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary\n",
      "magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his\n",
      "career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-\n",
      "old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In \"Brinkman's Note,\" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator\n",
      "appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the\n",
      "assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: \"The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the\n",
      "raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.\"\n",
      "After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. \"We really\n",
      "felt we were a peacetime generation,\" he recalls. \"There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.\"\n",
      "So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental\n",
      "commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen\n",
      "Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who\n",
      "want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers\n",
      "outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,\n",
      "required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance\n",
      "with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.\n",
      "In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of\n",
      "Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks\n",
      "of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as\n",
      "a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting\n",
      "tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that\n",
      "followed September 11th. \"He was very focused,\" says Annie. \"Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he\n",
      "wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.\"\n",
      "By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman\n",
      "during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander\n",
      "with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous \"stuff happens\"\n",
      "remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission\n",
      "Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —\n",
      "overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part\n",
      "in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.\n",
      "After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April\n",
      "2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He\n",
      "signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.\n",
      "(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander\n",
      "known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,\n",
      "specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. \"If the circumstances of\n",
      "Corporal Tillman's death become public,\" he wrote, it could cause \"public embarrassment\" for the president.\n",
      "\"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,\" wrote Tillman's mother,\n",
      "Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the \"golden\n",
      "boy\" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping\n",
      "the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.\n",
      "Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in\n",
      "Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of\n",
      "abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even\n",
      "though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so\n",
      "unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in\n",
      "Afghanistan, viewing them as a \"political swamp,\" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for\n",
      "his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the\n",
      "scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in\n",
      "Afghanistan.\n",
      "The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a\n",
      "dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a \"Jedi\" commander, as Newsweek called\n",
      "him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor\n",
      "rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on\n",
      "his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name\n",
      "and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (\"There are no limits. There are only plateaus,\n",
      "and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.\") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,\n",
      "unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. \"The fucking\n",

      "would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.\"\n",
      "It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite\n",
      "forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of\n",

      "In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront\n",
      "such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had\n",

      "\"I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,\" Arroyo\n",
      "wrote.\n",
      "Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: \"I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is\n",
      "something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend\n",
      "upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own.\" Then he showed up at Arroyo's\n",
      "outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live\n",
      "operation in a dangerous war zone.\n",
      "Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-\n",
      "old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED\n",
      "a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general\n",
      "would attend Ingram's memorial service. \"He started to look up to you,\" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to\n",
      "make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.\n",
      "The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM\n",
      "to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard\n",
      "towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen\n",
      "some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had\n",
      "repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a\n",
      "combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been\n",
      "denied. \"These were abandoned houses,\" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. \"Nobody was coming back to live in them.\"\n",
      "One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. \"Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably\n",
      "certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,\" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has\n",
      "traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't\n",
      "have to make arrests. \"Does that make any fucking sense?\" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. \"We should just drop a fucking\n",
      "bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?\"\n",
      "The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of\n",
      "command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. \"Fuck, when I came over here and\n",
      "heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,\" says Hicks, who has served three tours\n",
      "of combat. \"I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his\n",

      "thing.\"\n",
      "McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two\n",
      "dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. \"I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to\n",
      "understand the big picture as well,\" McChrystal begins. \"How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for\n",
      "yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?\" McChrystal says.\n",
      "\"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,\" says Hicks.\n",
      "McChrystal nods. \"Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,\" he tells the men. \"You're leading by example.\n",
      "That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside.\" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about\n",
      "counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,\n",
      "but he's careful not to bullshit the men. \"We are knee-deep in the decisive year,\" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no\n",
      "longer has the initiative — \"but I don't think we do, either.\" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any\n",
      "hearts and minds among the soldiers. \"This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,\" McChrystal tries to joke.\n",
      "\"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.\"\n",
      "During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use\n",
      "lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they\n",
      "did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,\" one soldier says.\n",
      "\"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,\" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't\n",
      "kill your way out of Afghanistan. \"The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,\" the soldier persists. \"You say we've stopped the momentum of the\n",
      "insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's\n",
      "getting.\"\n",
      "\"I agree with you,\" McChrystal says. \"In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,\n",
      "you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out\n",
      "here and resettle it?\"\n",
      "A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a\n",
      "civilian. \"That's the way this game is,\" McChrystal says. \"It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill\n",
      "all the shirts.\"\n",
      "As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one\n",
      "last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. \"There's no way I can make that easier,\" he tells\n",

      "When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here\n",
      "was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.\n",
      "The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent\n",
      "memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).\n",
      "McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,\n",
      "expensive and easy to lose. \"Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,\" he says. But even if he somehow manages to\n",
      "succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to\n",
      "shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,\n",
      "roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying\n",

      "It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no\n",
      "real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. \"It was one of our first\n",
      "impressions,\" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. \"So many\n",
      "lights shining brightly.\" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of\n",
      "progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have\n",
      "mocked. \"They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even\n",
      "defined or recognizable,\" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political\n",
      "adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. \"That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is\n",

      "counterinsurgency campaign even further. \"There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next\n",
      "summer if we see success here,\" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.\n",
      "Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of \"progress,\"\n",
      "McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning\n",
      "to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original\n",
      "home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that\n",
      "McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more\n",
      "groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like\n",
      "Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a \"rising tide of security.\" The Afghan police and\n",
      "army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city\n",
      "to win over the civilian population.\n",
      "Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. \"This isn't a classic operation,\" says a\n",
      "U.S. military official. \"It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in.\" Other U.S. officials\n",
      "insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.\n",
      "\"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,\" says a military official. \"We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way\n",
      "that doesn't alienate the population.\" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders\n",
      "say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.\n",
      "\"This looks like CT-plus!\" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.\n",
      "Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years\n",
      "of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that\n",
      "COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his\n",
      "influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things\n",
      "worse. \"Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,\" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who\n",

      "and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers\" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility\n",
      "among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the\n",

      "for the diversity of the region that surrounds him, which I, at any event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing\n",

      "the growing centre of the global economy, as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were then\n",

      "But it is also Yeo's ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.\n",

      "tour de force conversations in which he specialises.\n",
      "It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd's proposal to establish an Asia-Pacific\n",
      "Community. The Prime Minister wanted the US, India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal with\n",
      "strategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapore's hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thought\n",
      "that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it is a key member, could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether the\n",

      "\"The vision is going to change dramatically, with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. The\n",

      "eventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangle\n",
      "consisting of the US, China and India.\"\n",
      "Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being in\n",
      "harmony on the evolution of regional organisations. This is how he saw it having played out: \"When Prime Minister Rudd\n",
      "proposed the APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round the region. He did not visit all countries. He made it quite\n",
      "plain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon the\n",
      "conclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region.\n",
      "\"To PM Rudd's credit he quickly clarified this, that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was his\n",
      "vision from the very beginning. I said, 'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that'.\n",
      "\"Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian region\n",
      "apparently centred on China, Japan and Korea. It created, as you would expect, a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. That\n",
      "got us all thinking in the region. How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that's comfortable. For a long time\n",
      "we've been thinking about China, more recently about India.\" Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations also\n",
      "evolved slowly, in particular the East Asia Summit, which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN, China,\n",
      "Japan, South Korea and India. He said: \"It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be based\n",
      "on the ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir\n",
      "(Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. \"Others felt that's too limiting. If it's just ASEAN plus three, that may be a little lop-sided\n",
      "because of the economic weight of the plus three. So we thought if we have India on one side, and Australia and New\n",
      "Zealand to the south, there's a certain natural equipoise.\n",
      "\"Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is too\n",
      "important a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS at\n",
      "that time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS might\n",
      "exclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing because\n",
      "Australia and New Zealand were in it. In any case, countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive.\n",
      "What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs.\"\n",
      "So where do we end up today? \"When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. So\n",
      "now there are two possibilities, either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (including\n",
      "the US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the end\n",
      "he's happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn't want to interfere in our regional discussion.\"\n",
      "So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody is going to call it the\n",
      "Asia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder, as everyone accepts that Bob Hawke\n",
      "founded APEC in 1989. On the other hand, it does seem as though it's very much more than likely that there will finally\n",
      "be a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India, which is able to discuss security. That is pretty\n",
      "much Rudd's policy aim and, as Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends of Rudd can\n",
      "describe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative. His enemies can say the APC came to nothing\n",
      "and was a failure in Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light. There is only space to give the\n",
      "smallest sampling of Yeo's prodigiously rich insights on other issues.\n",
      "On the US, he said: \"Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for many\n",
      "decades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas, always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We in\n",
      "Singapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties.\"\n",
      "On China, I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power, financial and military, so\n",
      "it could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody. Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing's\n",
      "preoccupations were internal, and said: \"China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India\n",
      "and already No 2 for New Zealand, and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction.\"\n",
      "(The historical process) is high drama in China. It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoism\n",
      "developed as a different ideology from Bolshevism. China was 20 per cent urban. It's now 40 per cent urban and will go\n",
      "to 80 per cent or 90 per cent. The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison, but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo.\n",
      "Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation. In China it's all compressed. If they succeed\n",
      "they will be the greatest nation on Earth. The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks. The skills which brought them\n",
      "to power won't keep them in power.\"\n",
      "He recalled that early in China's economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore, as a mostly\n",
      "Chinese nation, ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner, combining rapid economic growth with social\n",
      "order and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again in\n",

      "city. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians' electoral clinics in Singapore, observing how real problems are\n",
      "recognised, integrated into the system and dealt with.\n",
      "I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. He\n",
      "replied: \"Their politics now are a mess. Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely, reconfiguring the pieces is-\n",

      "finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only\n",

      "minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to\n",
      "yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,\n",

      "Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. \"The position on the other side\n",

      "For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens\n",
      "on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats\n",
      "while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't\n",
      "have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to\n",
      "make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One\n",
      "amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less\n",
      "than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a\n",
      "Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican\n",

      "buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra\n",
      "amendment without cracking a smile. \"This is not a game amendment,\" he insisted. \"It actually saves money.\"\n",
      "So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.\n",
      "\"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate,\" Baucus declared. \"It is a crass\n",
      "political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy.\" Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a\n",
      "clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. \"Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins.\" Thirty-five-second pause. \"Mr. Conrad, Mr.\n",

      "eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting\n",

      "\"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue,\" he said.\n",
      "Instead, a senator typically gives \"a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets\n",

      "While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits\n",
      "from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.\n",
      "Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same\n",
      "morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing\n",
      "can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten\n",
      "rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend\n",
      "four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their\n",
      "home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and\n",
      "to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he\n",
      "told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,\n",
      "\"When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there\n",

      "behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate\n",
      "office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee\n",

      "In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time\n",
      "to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million\n",
      "dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups\n",
      "were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising\n",
      "and lobbying, said, \"People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills\n",
      "are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money.\"\n",
      "Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: \"Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,\n",

      "just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no\n",
      "vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if\n",
      "you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because\n",
      "I don't have a clue.\"\n",
      "Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few\n",
      "decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,\n",
      "who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to\n",
      "push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating\n",
      "the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.\n",
      "One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. \"You know about all\n",
      "these rags that cover the Hill, right?\" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,\n",
      "and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of\n",
      "the \"24/7 media,\" provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a \"dust-up\" between Scott\n",
      "Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;\n",
      "the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the\n",

      "both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with\n",
      "Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall\n",
      "noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to\n",
      "bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the \"inner sanctum,\" where\n",
      "Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls\n",
      "such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. \"You\n",
      "learned, and also you found out what was going on,\" Dodd said, adding, \"It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about\n",
      "someone that you just had lunch with.\" These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their\n",
      "respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else \"downtown,\" which means asking donors for money over\n",
      "steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the \"caucus lunch\" was instituted by Republicans in\n",
      "the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work\n",
      "members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry\n",
      "Reid as an idiot. \"At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,\" Alexander joked, adding, \"We spend most of\n",
      "our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other.\"\n",
      "In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. \"They kind of dwindled off during the\n",

      "These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers\n",
      "who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of\n",

      "The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.\n",
      "The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.\n",
      "For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a\n",
      "levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply\n",
      "impressed by the quality of its members: \"They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts\n",
      "animating it, not the petty passions.\" But he also recognized that \"a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could\n",
      "completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of\n",
      "constitutional government.\" As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,\n",
      "Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.\n",
      "Robert A. Caro, in \"Master of the Senate,\" the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •\n",

      "Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists\n",
      "and Republican corporate shills, and was \"the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—\n",
      "the chief obstructive force in the federal government.\" By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than\n",
      "the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book \"Citadel,\" called the Senate \"to a most peculiar\n",
      "degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly\" and \"the only place in the\n",
      "country where the South did not lose the war.\"\n",
      "By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film \"Advise and\n",
      "Consent,\" based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and\n",
      "Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in\n",
      "its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one\n",
      "another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,\n",
      "no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.\n",
      "In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's \"famous 'club' atmosphere is\n",
      "based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard\n",
      "at one another in debate over serious matters,\" but, he writes, \"understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course\n",
      "of the Senate day was essential to sanity.\" Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his\n",
      "will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either \"whales\"—the heavyweight chairmen who\n",
      "negotiated legislation—or \"minnows,\" the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a\n",
      "formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip\n",
      "Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of \"The Fall of the House of\n",

      "campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed\n",
      "jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,\n",

      "The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and\n",
      "accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. \"The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of\n",
      "people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs,\" Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. \"They\n",

      "who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, \"It was a huge loss of the most experienced,\n",
      "accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there\n",
      "less than six years.\" He added, \"The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets\n",
      "worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others\n",

      "After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals\n",
      "began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. \"So Damn Much Money,\" a recent book by the Washington Post\n",

      "began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan\n",
      "coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own\n",
      "fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members\n",
      "of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to\n",
      "regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in\n",

      "independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every\n",
      "election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,\n",
      "no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was\n",

      "them, making it extremely difficult. (\"Rule XXII is a Catch-22,\" Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different\n",
      "idea—the \"constitutional option.\" Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that \"each House may determine the Rules\n",
      "of its Proceedings\" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and\n",

      "spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is \"broken.\" Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were\n",
      "exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. \"The Senate wasn't\n",
      "created to be efficient,\" he argued. \"It was created to be inefficient.\" At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,\n",
      "sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing\n",

      "Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is\n",
      "inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,\n",
      "a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and\n",
      "so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. \"I would oppose that,\" Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,\n",

      "real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout\n",
      "Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs\n",

      "through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of\n",
      "a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan\n",
      "Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still\n",
      "talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's \"Odd Couple.\" By February, they had finished\n",
      "their work.\n",
      "Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,\n",
      "dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the\n",
      "committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed\n",
      "McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. \"It was an odd place to be,\" Corker recalled. \"And yet that night we\n",

      "response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists\n",
      "that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the\n",
      "Party's line on financial reform.)\n",
      "On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, \"You've been a great\n",
      "partner.\" He was ending their talks after only a month. \"It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest,\" Corker told reporters\n",
      "afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the\n",
      "rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks\n",
      "under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other\n",

      "paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.\n",
      "But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting\n",
      "talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a \"partisan bill\" that \"will guarantee\n",
      "perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks.\" McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,\n",
      "suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.\n",
      "His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded\n",

      "not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why\n",

      "scraping across a tile floor. \"Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room,\" Manley said. \"Very little happens around\n",
      "here without a deadline.\" The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks\n",
      "later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a\n",
      "vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for\n",
      "an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work\n",
      "of many months with Warner.\n",
      "\"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!\" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained\n",

      "Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because \"the American people don't trust either political party enough\n",
      "to give them a blank check,\" was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. \"There was zero\n",
      "substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes,\" he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the\n",
      "bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, \"If you want to vote against something, you\n",
      "can always find your reasons.\"\n",
      "But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating\n",
      "himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty\n",
      "minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. \"I am obviously disappointed,\" he said. \"I think I have spent as\n",
      "much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in\n",
      "it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time\n",
      "was spent on some of the core issues.\"\n",
      "As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of \"So Damn Much Money,\" in the press gallery. I later\n",
      "asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the\n",
      "Senate. \"If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money\n",
      "and interest groups,\" he said. \"But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things\n",
      "considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here\n",
      "you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.\"\n",
      "After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,\n",
      "smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, \"For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it\n",
      "didn't work.\" He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with \"some Nevadans.\"\n",
      "Durbin said, \"I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take\n",
      "to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?\"\n",
      "Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, \"I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its\n",

      "On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial\n",

      "and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,\n",
      "Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.\n",
      "And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,\n",

      "So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doing\n",
      "more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan \"culture\" does not\n",

      "assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.\n",
      "Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,\n",
      "despite increasing female recruitment and even \"female engagement teams,\" remains a bastion of masculinity, with little\n",

      "many years.\n",
      "A number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way.\n",
      "But the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter -- was to provide Congress and the American people with a\n",

      "detailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progress\n",

      "I have to say, I've been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while I\n",

      "idea what our objectives are on the civilian front.\n",
      "And I don't know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time,\n",
      "from the standpoint of -- of hearing, though.\n",
      "And I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we'll have maybe Secretary\n",

      "going.\n",
      "I'd also like to know how the withdrawal date that's been set affects that and how it affects those we're working with\n",
      "in the country.\n",
      "HOLBROOKE:\n",
      "First of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the\n",
      "constraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the record\n",
      "and which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs.\n",
      "The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedented\n",
      "effort.\n",
      "Now, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural products\n",
      "until 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of this\n",
      "war.\n",
      "We have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely in\n",
      "a joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs,\n",
      "encouraging alternatives to opium production.\n",
      "HOLBROOKE:\n",
      "Secondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice\n",
      "system which can cut into the Taliban's propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system.\n",
      "Third, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing by\n",
      "eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban.\n",
      "Fourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level.\n",
      "Fifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. Senator\n",
      "Kerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the\n",
      "international presence.\n",
      "The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus' counter-\n",
      "insurgency effort. He and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. We have worked\n",
      "intimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish\n",
      "in private briefings on behalf of me and my team.\n",
      "Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end state\n",
      "and exit strategy.\n",
      "If we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, the\n",
      "consequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction\n",
      "that would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan's west, Iran, as well as the larger region that\n",
      "includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism from\n",
      "that region, just as much as we are.\n",
      "So, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued\n",
      "American economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the\n",
      "military. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for\n",
      "the military campaign.\n",
      "When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won't be on a single day. It will\n",
      "be a gradual process. And that is what the review in December and the president's decision-making will focus on.\n",
      "CORKER:\n",
      "In our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've had some rough times over the last several years -- it's been\n",
      "something that we've been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you're dealing with, that\n",
      "we're dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough.\n",
      "I still don't -- I haven't understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That's not to be critical of\n",
      "them. I just don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It's\n",
      "just incredibly vague to me.\n",
      "And I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don't\n",
      "know what we're doing. They don't know when we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've just had\n",
      "colleagues who have come from there.\n",
      "We've had a -- we've got a president there that's having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because he\n",
      "doesn't know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know what our intentions are, I don't think. And they're\n",
      "making accommodations on both sides.\n",
      "So, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we\n",
      "are in Afghanistan, because we're in Afghanistan, and that we don't have the will to be successful. And we don't have\n",
      "the will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined.\n",
      "But I just don't hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that's\n",
      "what we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship.\n",
      "But I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don't understand. OK? And I have average intelligence,\n",
      "so I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let's have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific.\n",
      "But I don't understand, and I'm very concerned.\n",
      "And I think we're sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there's a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, even\n",
      "within the administration itself, and that has to end.\n",
      "And I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven't done that today. And I would\n",
      "ask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envision\n",
      "Afghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand.\n",
      "We've changed it. Now it's sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it's not out of control. I mean, the\n",
      "bar continues to change. And I'm just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same page\n",
      "as much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined.\n",
      "HOLBROOKE:\n",
      "Senator, I'm sorry that my answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understand\n",
      "your comments and I respect them.\n",
      "First of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I'm asked by everybody -- why are we\n",
      "in Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that while\n",
      "our enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have to\n",
      "strengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can move\n",
      "forward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida.\n",
      "Now, if you do not believe that it's a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I think\n",
      "the Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is.\n",
      "Secondly, on the civilian mission, again, it's in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And we\n",
      "have benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here is\n",
      "always the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States.\n",
      "And we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face out\n",
      "there is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred, and I don't think anything could\n",
      "have proved it more vividly.\n",
      "And to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy's structure -- a\n",
      "different part, but an integral part -- that we face.\n",
      "Now, the Afghan government doesn't yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. How could they after 30 years\n",
      "of war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I've just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law,\n",
      "subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment and a whole series of other major issues --\n",
      "are part of our civilian programs.\n",
      "And we're happy to come back up to your office -- we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue.\n",
      "Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it's designed to help Afghan institutions establish\n",
      "conditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues,\n",
      "and we're happy to discuss them in detail at any time.He is calling to complain about Ambassador Holbrooke. He feels that Holbrooke is condescending and not forthcoming,\n",
      "including at this week's hearing. He also has broader concerns about the lack of a clear end state and metrics for our\n",
      "Afghan policy, but the main reason he wants to talk to you is about Holbrooke.\n",
      "Holbrooke tried to faithfully answer his questions and frankly Corker was looking for a sound byte and he got one. We\n",
      "can offer him additional briefings and a readout after your upcoming trip if that would help.\n",
      "You could use also this opportunity to thank him for sitting down earlier this week on the New START Treaty; to note\n",

      "Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and\n",

      "Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million\n",

      "Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14\n",
      "cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held \"without\n",
      "preconditions,\" and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.\n",
      "But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to\n",
      "enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40\n",
      "points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he\n",
      "had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.\n",
      "The illuminating movie \"Friendship Games,\" to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along\n",

      "If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then\n",
      "he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the\n",

      "was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process\n",
      "with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?\n",
      "What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's\n",
      "approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with\n",
      "another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist\n",
      "Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple\n",
      "Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?\n",

      "his zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited\n",
      "to begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,\n",

      "nature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This\n",

      "that outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract\n",
      "from Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on\n",
      "the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and\n",
      "minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective\n",
      "negotiators work out the details\n",
      "2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating\n",
      "the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides\n",
      "potentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for\n",
      "the reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining\n",

      "it. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of\n",
      "you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that\n",
      "reflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and\n",
      "clearer mandate than currently is the case.\n",
      "3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most\n",

      "usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the\n",
      "present seriously wrong.\n",
      "Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:\n",
      "\"we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to\n",
      "give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term\n",
      "investments in new growth engines.\"\n",
      "The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due\n",
      "to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to\n",
      "maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also\n",
      "tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other\n",
      "countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large\n",
      "and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,\n",
      "preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing\n",
      "bubble) until just before the crash.\n",
      "There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by\n",
      "the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do\n",
      "with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given\n",
      "the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic\n",
      "production without borrowing from abroad.\n",
      "Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'\n",
      "reluctance to hire as the result of \"unusual uncertainty,\" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman\n",
      "Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance\n",
      "to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their\n",
      "demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.\n",
      "This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase\n",
      "in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far\n",
      "shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.\n",
      "Later he tells readers:\n",
      "\"America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the\n",
      "rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and\n",

      "whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for\n",
      "less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers\n",
      "might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),\n",
      "coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly\n",
      "educated workers as well as less educated workers.\n",
      "Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:\n",
      "\"There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that\n",

      "\"Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The\n",
      "Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and\n",

      "Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,\n",
      "but its past as the \"sick man of Europe\" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany\n",

      "The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in\n",
      "spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of\n",
      "demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,\n",
      "greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the\n",
      "economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that\n",
      "increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.\n",
      "The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't\n",
      "have access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be\n",

      "Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine\n",
      "remains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the\n",

      "installment of the \"peace process\" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and\n",
      "also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the\n",

      "evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and\n",
      "Americans.\n",
      "To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new \"peace process\" have officially acknowledged or\n",
      "responded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel\n",
      "make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,\n",
      "ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.\n",
      "In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's \"right to exist\" the central purpose of the \"peace process\" offends\n",
      "Arabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well\n",
      "beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem\n",
      "to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and\n",
      "the manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and\n",
      "accept peace?\n",
      "Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a\n",
      "homeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of\n",
      "Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking\n",
      "them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they\n",
      "recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral\n",
      "expansion at Palestinian expense.\n",
      "The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns\n",
      "about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.\n",
      "peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of\n",
      "acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.\n",
      "Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with\n",
      "incredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis\n",
      "and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement\n",
      "of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a \"peace process\" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of\n",
      "carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.\n",
      "The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously\n",
      "unpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of\n",

      "As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic\n",
      "has two quite different words that are both translated as \"negotiation,\" making a distinction that doesn't exist in either\n",
      "English or Hebrew. One word, \"musaawama,\" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in\n",
      "bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each\n",
      "other. Another, \"mufaawadhat,\" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that\n",
      "take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.\n",
      "Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of\n",
      "mufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It\n",
      "called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with\n",
      "intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on\n",
      "which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.\n",
      "I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic\n",
      "effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands\n",
      "things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the\n",
      "reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand\n",
      "how others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are\n",
      "long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential\n",
      "militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have\n",
      "forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.\n",
      "I am not myself an \"Arabist,\" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the\n",
      "American diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and\n",
      "empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw\n",
      "as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our\n",
      "Middle East diplomacy.\n",
      "This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for\n",
      "what must be done.\n",
      "In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed\n",
      "Europeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -\n",
      "but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross\n",
      "injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as\n",
      "friendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of\n",
      "anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to\n",
      "the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.\n",
      "Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination\n",
      "for Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest\n",
      "in ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions\n",
      "with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as\n",
      "they very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue\n",
      "and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.\n",
      "As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long\n",
      "transcended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all\n",
      "sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of\n",
      "religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure\n",
      "freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest\n",
      "that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.\n",
      "There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is\n",
      "generally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects\n",
      "pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting\n",
      "may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the\n",
      "achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's that\n",
      "others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not\n",
      "expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.\n",
      "Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was\n",
      "happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them\n",
      "from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected\n",
      "from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.\n",
      "This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most\n",
      "Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending\n",
      "the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to\n",
      "present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the\n",
      "Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint\n",
      "or parallel action on behalf of peace.\n",
      "Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.\n",
      "First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted\n",
      "than most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have\n",
      "published some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its\n",
      "contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab\n",
      "League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the\n",
      "Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation\n",
      "with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab\n",
      "Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations with\n",
      "both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a\n",
      "well-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.\n",
      "Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who\n",
      "are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so\n",
      "as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace\n",
      "partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has\n",
      "acted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity\n",
      "government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong\n",
      "domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some\n",

      "Avner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,\n",
      "and why would that be good for Israel?\n",
      "\"Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a\n",
      "comprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just\n",
      "anachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, it\n",
      "undermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the\n",
      "responsible states in this strategic field.\"\n",
      "Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually\n",
      "marginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •\n",
      "\"Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state'\n",
      "surrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then.\n",
      "\"In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it\n",
      "will be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the\n",
      "nuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don't have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.\"\n",
      "The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin\n",
      "Netanyahu's visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the\n",
      "threats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.\n",
      "The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look\n",
      "as though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don't\n",
      "believe this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.\"\n",
      "Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands\n",
      "that Israel disarm?\n",
      "\"Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody 'demands that Israel make such an announcement without\n",
      "first doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel\n",
      "has its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.\"\n",
      "What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race\n",
      "against Israel?\n",
      "\"I don't dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be\n",
      "prepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though\n",
      "they were children: If they are told that Israel doesn't admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I\n",
      "believe the Arab countries don't want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and\n",
      "realistically.\"\n",
      "You say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel\n",
      "supporters.\n",
      "\"But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can\n",
      "even remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.\n",
      "\"If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international\n",
      "community thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear\n",
      "weapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less\n",
      "patience the world will have for Israel.\"\n",
      "How do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?'\n",
      "\"Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is\n",
      "very hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more\n",
      "openly.\n",
      "\"Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there\n",
      "is no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.\n",
      "\"On the international level, it's a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by\n",
      "Israel's government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk\n",
      "about the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these\n",
      "weapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don't think Israel would need to go into detail\n",
      "regarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.\n",
      "\"Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are\n",
      "sinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. This\n",
      "is a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something\n",
      "positive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...\n",
      "\"All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.\n",
      "Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I can't say.\"\n",
      "You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the\n",
      "question of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?\n",
      "\"There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an\n",
      "unacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives from the fact that Israeli society\n",
      "accepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.\n",
      "\"Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be\n",
      "handled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.\n",

      "By Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky and Samuel W. Lewis\n",
      "Faltering Middle East peace talks need a jolt. Washington has a powerful option for moving the process forward: taking\n",
      "a firm stand on how to end the conflict.\n",
      "An American declaration of principles—carefully crafted and properly marketed--could spark a debate and thereby\n",
      "change the political calculus for leaders. As a mediator and a world power, one of America's strongest assets is the\n",
      "ability to legitimize ideas and then rally others in support. A central role for the U.S. in this conflict must be to define the\n",
      "zone of negotiability.\n",
      "This does not mean imposing peace. Rather, it would be a statement of the basic principles the U.S. believes can guide\n",
      "the parties toward a negotiated solution. America has long declared its support for \"two states,\" but must now say more\n",
      "about what that means in practice.\n",
      "Even if the current talks resume, without American ideas the parties are unlikely to agree on the broad trade-offs\n",
      "necessary to reach a peace deal. A quick deal on \"borders and security,\" as many have proposed, is itself unlikely\n",
      "without Washington addressing the end-game. Otherwise, both sides would be too exposed on issues set for later\n",
      "discussion, like Jerusalem and refugees. Opinion polling has consistently showed that support for peace is strongest\n",
      "when all the core issues are addressed.\n",
      "An American statement of principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, for the first time, a public\n",
      "framework for engaging sponsors of the Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen our ability to reassert the\n",
      "importance of a regional support structure for the bilateral negotiations, especially by reviving multilateral contacts and\n",
      "meetings involving Israelis and their neighbors from throughout the region. Moreover, greater regional engagement on\n",
      "the peace process can carry powerful benefits for regional challenges like the Iranian nuclear program.\n",
      "A clearer U.S. declaration is also the surest way to protect prospects for a two-state solution from an unrelenting\n",
      "onslaught on the ground that pushes the parties away from a peace deal. An American set of ideas would anchor\n",
      "present-day demands on issues like Jerusalem, security and settlements in a clear vision of the future.\n",
      "Perhaps most urgently, it would broaden the debate from the narrow confines of the settlements question.\n",
      "At a minimum, the American declaration should be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps; support a\n",
      "compromise on Jerusalem that allows for two capitals for two states; include provisions about security limitations and\n",
      "guarantees; reiterate America's support for an agreed solution to the refugee problem; and reaffirm our long-standing\n",
      "commitment to the State of Israel. But American principles should also include some caveat, given that our ultimate\n",
      "interest is in an agreed, viable solution—not in any particular formula.\n",
      "What would it take for American ideas to succeed? Unlike some past efforts, Washington should not try to 'pre-cook'\n",
      "this declaration with one or more parties or to choreograph their reactions. In fact, the U.S. statement of principles\n",
      "would be explicitly described as what our own country believes in and can support; and by implication cannot support.\n",
      "Thus, the U.S. statement would not be designed to achieve immediate approval or adoption by the parties. Its purpose\n",
      "would be to clarify where America stands, how we define our interests and what we can work for. It would aim at\n",
      "influencing the climate of thinking in the region, sobering up those with illusions and encouraging those who need our\n",
      "support.\n",
      "Timing and context are of course key considerations. Assuming the current gridlock in negotiations persists, some time\n",
      "must elapse until our election results have been digested, here and abroad, and before public attention can be\n",
      "redirected toward the foreboding and increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate.\n",
      "A presidential speech will then be essential to dramatize the seriousness of our purpose and to lay out the principles. It\n",
      "should be immediately followed by a major, high level diplomatic effort to persuade key Middle East leaders and our\n",
      "Quartet and UN allies of our genuine desire to regionalize the peacemaking effort. To maximize support from key\n",
      "members of Congress, the speech should occur before Congress adjourns. No further consultation with the stalemated\n",
      "parties beyond the routine should precede the speech, and leaks of its contents must be kept to an absolute minimum if\n",
      "our purpose is not to be undermined.\n",
      "The speech could usefully also remove some of the veil of silence that shrouds breakthroughs in past negotiations; for\n",
      "example, progress in the Annapolis process.\n",

      "based on presenting American ideas to the parties. It is a way to entice skeptical Israelis, but it also leads back to a long\n",
      "overdue need for Washington to engage on the Arab Peace Initiative.\n",
      "If the U.S. puts forward its own peace principles, American leadership can ensure that any diplomatic process is defined\n",
      "by as clear a picture as possible of what the parties can expect to gain through a negotiated settlement, and of what\n",
      "they will never gain without one.\n",
      "Skeptics say it is too risky to present American ideas to the parties, that it would pull the rug out from under current\n",

      "support compromise, and could very well precipitate a crisis on the ground. Others simply worry about the cost to\n",
      "American prestige should any of the key players react negatively. But the risks are overstated, and a complete collapse\n",
      "of the process would be far more dangerous, particularly as the strategic environment shifts in favor of regional forces\n",

      "The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services\n",
      "for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the\n",

      "the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,\n",
      "lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance\n",

      "slogan was \"The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You.\" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,\n",
      "who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.\n",
      "Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that\n",
      "libertarians were getting ready to stage \"a very big tea party,\" because people were \"sick to death\" of taxes. The Libertarian\n",
      "Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the\n",
      "Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage\n",

      "and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a\n",
      "more traditional conservative, called the movement \"Anarcho-Totalitarianism.\"\n",
      "That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of\n",

      "corrupting business,\" he told a reporter at the time. \"I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas.\" According to Doherty's\n",
      "book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely \"actors playing out a script.\" A longtime confidant of the Kochs\n",

      "America, they had to \"influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.\"\n",
      "fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million\n",
      ". dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family\n",
      "foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which\n",
      "they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and\n",

      "more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.\n",
      "Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's\n",

      "Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a\n",
      "rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, \"Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.\"\n",
      "Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable\n",
      "foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National\n",

      "according to one participant, were \"very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.\"\n",
      "Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated\n",
      "their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of \"a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil\n",
      "from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring.\" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one\n",
      "million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil\n",
      "measurement is \"a very uncertain art.\"\n",
      "To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon\n",
      "opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without\n",
      "issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal\n",
      "lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,\n",
      "the counsel to the Senate committee, said, \"These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'\n",

      "By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of\n",
      "corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on\n",
      "Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.\n",
      "And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as \"designed to strike fear into the hearts of\n",

      "their victim,\" he said.\n",
      "The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made\n",
      "it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff\n",
      "group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems \"myths.\" When the\n",
      "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had \"no citizen membership of its own.\"\n",
      "In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called \"an audacious plan to pour millions\n",
      "of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,\" in order to evade\n",
      "campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in\n",
      "twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,\n",
      "the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that \"the trust was financed in whole or in\n",
      "part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas.\" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,\n",
      "most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,\n",
      "the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the\n",
      "money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had\n",
      "been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as \"historic. Triad was the\n",

      "which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two\n",
      "hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to\n",
      "spend five million dollars on environmental projects.\n",
      "In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion\n",
      "that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final\n",
      "months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for\n",
      "covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company\n",
      "was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.\n",
      "The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including\n",
      "the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,\n",
      "headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as \"one of the most significant cases ever\n",
      "brought under the Clean Air Act.\" He added, \"Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,\n",
      "and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.\"\n",
      "During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies\n",
      "of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed\n",
      "remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered\n",
      "enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a\n",

      "2000.\n",
      "In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The\n",
      "group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for\n",
      "John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political\n",
      "purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)\n",
      "That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink\n",
      "started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had\n",
      "worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-\n",
      "consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography\n",
      "describes him as an expert in \"grasstops\" and \"grassroots\" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even\n",

      "By ERIC LIPTON\n",
      "WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory\n",
      "overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry\n",
      "lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.\n",
      "The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street\n",
      "lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water\n",
      "it down.\n",
      "\"We need you to get out there and speak up against this,\" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three\n",
      "people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.\n",
      "That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual\n",
      "for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He\n",
      "maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest\n",
      "businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.\n",
      "They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their\n",
      "corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for\n",
      "his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.\n",
      "Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as\n",
      "often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped\n",
      "them out.\n",
      "As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama\n",
      "mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,\n",
      "cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.\n",
      "The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met \"countless times with\n",
      "special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation\" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.\n",
      "And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he \"epitomizes the\n",
      "smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.\"\n",
      "Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically\n",
      "motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that\n",
      "he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small\n",
      "plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.\n",
      "\"I get lobbied every day by somebody,\" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. \"It could be by my wife. It could be\n",
      "the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.\"\n",
      "Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt\n",
      "Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his\n",
      "reputation as a \"Chamber of Commerce\" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for\n",
      "Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.\n",
      "If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds\n",
      "coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong\n",
      "with that.\n",
      "\"Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,\" said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm\n",
      "represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse\n",

      "In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,\n",
      "surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to\n",
      "discuss why he believes that literature can change the world.\n",
      "Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is\n",
      "perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,\n",
      "or who claim that they have \"no time\" for fiction.\n",
      "In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature \"an important place in the life\n",
      "of nations.\" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best\n",
      "protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.\"\n",
      "Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value\n",
      "of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he\n",
      "is among the most successful.\n",
      "Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.\n",
      "A case in point is \"Conversation in the Cathedral,\" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue\n",
      "first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which\n",
      "is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how\n",
      "dictatorships impregnate \"every act of life.\"\n",
      "To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book\n",
      "opens with a grim landscape of \"uneven and faded buildings\" and describes \"dull and defeated eyes at the\n",
      "tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer.\" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from\n",
      "past to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.\n",
      "Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in \"The Feast of the Goat,\" which explicitly details the horrors of\n",
      "the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, and\n",
      "so we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. \"The\n",
      "woman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,\" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.\n",
      "For some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory will be controversial because of his political background and his\n",
      "outspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During the\n",
      "campaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and private\n",

      "ending what he called the \"monstrous dictatorship\" of Saddam Hussein.\n",
      "Mr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or as\n",
      "he told me in Lima: 'Through writing, one can change history.\"\n",
      "Not all of his work is dark. \"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\" is punctuated with humor, and 'The Bad Girl,\" about\n",

      "by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010\n",
      "ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.\n",
      "A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite\n",
      "props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. \"I've got my pipe,\" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the\n",
      "stem, \"because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things.\" The theme of the day was \"Restoring History,\" and\n",
      "Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of\n",
      "history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by \"malicious progressive intent.\" Progressives, he\n",
      "explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—\"knew they had to separate us from our\n",
      "history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God.\" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the\n",
      "history that \"is being stolen from us\": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the\n",
      "nation from the \"near-depression\" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. \"You've been taught\n",
      "one lie, I think, your whole life,\" he said.\n",
      "For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon\n",
      "convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by\n",
      "Democracy Corps, showed that he is \"the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,\" seen not merely\n",
      "as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an \"educator.\" And in the past few months Beck has established his own\n",
      "institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with\n",
      "\"revisionists and secular progressives\" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist\n",
      "federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the\n",
      "division of powers.\n",
      "During the \"Restoring History\" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear\n",
      "\"lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find.\" The B.U. faculty consists of three\n",
      "members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at\n",
      "Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,\n",
      "which the Web site calls \"a national pro-family organization.\" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,\n",
      "on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons\n",
      "about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the\n",
      "early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and\n",
      "the graduated federal income tax came into existence. \"Wilson,\" Beck told his radio audience in August, \"just despised\n",
      "what America was.\"\n",
      "Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom\n",
      "Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, \"The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow\n",
      "Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill.\" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from\n",
      "Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that \"the very things you see happening in this country today\n",
      "started with the Wilson Administration.\"\n",
      "At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as \"an\n",
      "unfettered new force of the middle class.\" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is\n",
      "audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of\n",
      "conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,\n",
      "especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.\n",
      "Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.\n",
      "Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,\n",
      "of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American\n",
      "history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist\n",
      "China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades\n",
      "inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to\n",
      "challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.\n",
      "The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist\n",
      "violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time\n",
      "deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called\n",
      "\"massive resistance\" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which\n",
      "claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a\n",
      "fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he\n",
      "resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing\n",
      "propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom\n",
      "Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly\n",
      "liberal domestic programs \"fall clearly within the category of socialism.\"\n",
      "The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert\n",
      "Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-\n",
      "intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the\n",
      "Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's\n",
      "followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was\n",
      "estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an \"immense\"\n",
      "domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract\n",
      "titled \"The Politician,\" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as \"a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist\n",
      "conspiracy\" who had been serving the plot \"all of his adult life.\" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he\n",
      "accused the Kennedy Administration of \"helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the\n",
      "opposite.\"\n",
      "Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of\n",
      "totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik\n",
      "Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as \"always and inevitably an\n",
      "enemy of individual freedom.\" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's\n",
      "role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson \"more than any other one\n",
      "man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.\"\n",
      "In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but \"a tool of the total\n",
      "conspiracy.\" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth\n",
      "century, in the \"uniformly Satanic creed and program\" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called \"the Insiders,\" the\n",

      "conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,\" Welch declared in 1966. \"The very same collectivist\n",
      "theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new\n",
      "and modern concepts.\"\n",
      "In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a\n",
      "nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the\n",
      "Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the\n",
      "populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. \"It isn't numbers we have to worry about,\" Welch wrote, \"but the\n",
      "courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.\"\n",
      "The \"Founder\" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and\n",
      "professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. \"It is the leadership that is most\n",
      "demanding, most exacting of its followers,\" Welch observed, \"that achieves really dedicated support.\" Welch's group\n",
      "became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly\n",
      "to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a\n",
      "humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.\n",
      "Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A\n",
      "transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early\n",
      "nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted\n",
      "that \"during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who\n",
      "are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes.\" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,\n",
      "from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed\n",
      "implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he\n",
      "had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.\n",
      "Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from\n",
      "1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card\n",
      "game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen \"a master of half\n",
      "truths\" and said that he ran the police department \"like a Gestapo\"; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the\n",
      "Mayor's lawn.\n",
      "After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an\n",
      "exemplar of the far-right \"ultras.\" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion\n",
      "Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled \"The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,\" which\n",
      "condemned the society's critics for \"promoting the official Communist Party line.\" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later\n",
      "defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called \"The Communist Attack on the\n",
      "Mormons.\")\n",
      "All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In \"The Naked Communist,\" a lengthy primer\n",
      "published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser\n",
      "Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first\n",
      "Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\"\n",
      "appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating \"a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds\n",
      "could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters.\" A later book, \"The Naked Capitalist,\" decried the\n",
      "Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller\n",
      "Foundation, formed \"the world's secret power structure.\" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like\n",
      "the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the\n",
      "Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.\n",
      "In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for\n",
      "Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets\n",
      "included \"the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal\n",
      "Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold\n",
      "standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social\n",
      "security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.\"\n",
      "Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing\n",
      "fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had \"gone\n",
      "off the deep end.\" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of \"inventing fantastic ideas and\n",
      "making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,\" and advancing doctrines that came \"perilously\n",
      "close\" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations\n",
      "and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his\n",
      "organizations.\n",
      "Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced \"The 5,000 Year Leap,\" a treatise that assembles selective quotations\n",
      "and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that\n",
      "the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often\n",
      "described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander\n",
      "Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. \"The 5,000 Year Leap\" is not a fervid\n",
      "book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of\n",
      "what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called \"the Utopian schemes of leveling,\" which Skousen equates with redistribution of\n",
      "wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas\n",
      "Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,\n",
      "which meant that \"the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made\n",
      "a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.\"\n",
      "Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that \"the Founders were not indulging in any idle\n",
      "gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' \"In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional\n",
      "Convention was \"E Pluribus Unum\": out of many, one. \"In God We Trust\" came much later; its use on coins was first\n",
      "permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.\n",
      "The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved \"In God We Trust\" as\n",
      "the national motto.\n",
      "In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,\" and\n",
      "prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative\n",
      "study of Beck, \"Common Nonsense,\" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California\n",
      "Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from\n",
      "long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as \"pickaninnies\" and\n",
      "suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of\n",
      "Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them \"a joke that no self-respecting scholar would\n",
      "think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.\"\n",
      "By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in\n",
      "2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: \"The Naked Communist,\" \"The Naked Capitalist,\" and, especially, \"The 5,000\n",
      "Year Leap,\" which he called \"essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did.\" After\n",
      "Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—\n",
      "it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand\n",
      "copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country\n",
      "have since organized study groups around it. \"It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding\n",
      "Fathers,\" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is\n",
      "the movement's teacher, \"The 5,000 Year Leap\" has become its primer, with \"The Making of America\" as a kind of 102-\n",
      "level text.\n",
      "The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an\n",
      "audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience\n",
      "that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that\n",
      "patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured \"Comrade Updates,\" in which Beck\n",
      "described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal\n",
      "Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign\n",
      "Relations (born of a \"progressive idea\" to manipulate the media in order to \"let the masses know what should be done\");\n",
      "and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow\n",
      "Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a\n",
      "diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from \"Secrets of the Federal Reserve,\" by Eustace Mullins. The book,\n",
      "commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful\n",
      "bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.\n",
      "Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing\n",
      "of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as \"the Roman symbol of Fascism\"—and then a picture of an old\n",
      "Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. \"Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was\n",
      "the President,\" he said. \"We've been on the road to Fascism for a while.\" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the\n",
      "ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor\n",
      "Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate\n",
      "the desire for peace.\n",
      "Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he\n",
      "was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term \"lunatic fringe\" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,\n",
      "and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big\n",
      "business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent\n",
      "American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies\n",
      "in order to restore competition among small companies. \"If America is not to have free enterprise,\" Wilson declared, \"then\n",
      "she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.\"\n",
      "In 2007, Beck, then the host of \"Glenn Beck,\" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society\n",
      "spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,\n",
      "\"and eventually all throughout the Americas.\" Beck told Antonio, \"When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I\n",
      "thought they were a bunch of nuts.\" But now, he said, \"you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me.\" His\n",
      "guest beamed. \"Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,\" Antonio said. \"We are just exposing the truth that's been\n",
      "out there for many, many years.\" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,\n",
      "proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on\n",
      "Communism in America as \"the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American\n",
      "history.\"\n",
      "Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under\n",
      "President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for\n",
      "a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.\n",
      "Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that \"the Constitution will be endangered and hang,\n",
      "as it were, by a single thread,\" and praised the John Birch Society as \"the most effective non-church organization in our\n",
      "fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism.\" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,\n",
      "intoning, \"Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming.\" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for\n",
      "\"getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch\n",
      "Society has been doing it for over 50 years.\"\n",
      "Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-\n",
      "sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was \"not involved with the Tea Party.\" Why, then,\n",
      "have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative\n",
      "Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron\n",

      "The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half\n",
      "century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in\n",
      "November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those \"discordant voices of\n",
      "extremism\" that \"equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with\n",
      "Communism.\" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as\n",
      "paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.\n",
      "The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor\n",
      "of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph\n",
      "McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was\n",
      "set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical\n",
      "conservatives their chance at national power. \"By 1961,\" his biographer John B. Judis writes, \"Buckley was beginning to\n",
      "worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even\n",
      "Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted.\" In the next two decades,\n",
      "with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that\n",
      "succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.\n",
      "As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be\n",
      "expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their\n",
      "fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch\n",
      "Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the\n",
      "conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of\n",
      "\"distorting reality\" and failing to make \"the crucial moral and political distinction\" between Communists and liberals, the\n",
      "magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.\n",
      "By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and\n",
      "he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged\n",
      "Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing \"kooks\"\n",
      "lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some \"nice guys,\" and that it would be injudicious\n",
      "to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in\n",
      "1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no\n",
      "vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\"\n",
      "In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats\n",
      "succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan \"In Your Heart, You Know He's\n",
      "Right,\" the Democrats shot back, \"In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts.\") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was\n",
      "undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon\n",
      "among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently\n",
      "been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-\n",
      "washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.\n",
      "Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had\n",
      "established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official\n",
      "at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. \"It seems to me that we\n",
      "ought to have a real chance of winning this year,\" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National\n",
      "Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge\n",
      "of Nixon's media operations.\n",
      "But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of\n",
      "the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.\n",
      "nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom\n",
      "Welch had called one of \"the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene.\" As President, in 1969,\n",
      "Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious\n",
      "appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place\n",
      "later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,\n",
      "Buckley and the mainstream of what he called \"responsible conservatism\" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives\n",
      "were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch\n",
      "Society.\n",
      "Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The\n",
      "conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's\n",
      "second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'\n",
      "internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had \"an indifference\n",
      "toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom.\" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read\n",
      "the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican\n",
      "Party and in national politics.\n",
      "In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.\n",
      "After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a\n",
      "shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,\n",
      "demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of\n",
      "Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His\n",
      "pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the\n",
      "relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision\n",
      "dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican\n",
      "moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-\n",
      "winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who\n",
      "understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.\n",
      "As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen\n",
      "Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style\n",
      "government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He\n",
      "appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief\n",
      "of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy\n",
      "adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and\n",
      "Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights\n",
      "legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan\n",
      "skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail\n",
      "Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed\n",
      "forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, \"a useful idiot for Soviet\n",
      "propaganda.\"\n",
      "Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the\n",
      "federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the\n",
      "standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to\n",
      "matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,\n",

      "The contents of \"Life\" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was\n",
      "persuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a\n",
      "picture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? \"I really can't explain it,\" he says, deadpan, about that now.\n",

      "It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to\n",
      "have done successfully 30 years ago. \"Stories like this aren't told very much,\" he insists. \"There aren't many people willing\n",

      "As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,\n",
      "unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young\n",

      "In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: \"It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'm\n",
      "trying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,\" he says. And sure: \"There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it\n",
      "all out, those things count for nothing.\" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of\n",
      "time. \"The important thing to me,\" he says, \"was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.\"And\n",
      "is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? \"No.\"\n",
      "But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As \"Life\" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is\n",
      "yes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls \"Keefs Guitar\n",
      "Workshop.\" Here are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on\n",
      "which they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for\n",

      "Hotel\" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.\n",
      "Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he is\n",
      "surprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to\n",
      "do so. What he finds most gratifying about having written \"Life\" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the\n",

      "It's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;\n",

      "story.\" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,\n",
      "no one looks terribly heroic.\n",
      "Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,\n",
      "and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a\n",
      "brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that\n",
      "he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.\n",
      "The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals\n",
      "did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what\n",
      "the generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after\n",
      "they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The\n",

      "As they say in Missouri, \"Give me a break.\" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what\n",

      "understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's\n",
      "wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the\n",
      "strategy all by himself.\n",
      "This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear\n",
      "enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to\n",
      "pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told\n",
      "Woodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the \"classic\" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. \"I think about it\n",
      "more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at\n",
      "the end?\" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011\n",
      "deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: \"I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole\n",
      "Democratic Party.\" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:\n",
      "\"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan.\" So, if he wanted such a plan, he\n",
      "should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.\n",
      "Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.\n",
      "And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom\n",
      "well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up\n",
      "their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,\n",
      "victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,\n",
      "Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not\n",
      "a happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.\n",

      "The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over\n",
      "naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and\n",

      "usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.\n",
      "There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than\n",
      "right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner\n",
      "sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My\n",
      "information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt\n",
      "that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost\n",
      "always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General\n",
      "McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm\n",
      "Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in\n",
      "advance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as\n",
      "much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified\n",
      "U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,\n",
      "that everything was \"conditions based.\" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.\n",
      "So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be\n",
      "going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: \"You have to recognize\n",

      "By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN\n",
      "Iran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of\n",
      "them in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when\n",
      "the hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.\n",
      "The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said\n",
      "that the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were\n",
      "close to the border but on the Iraqi side.\n",
      "The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a\n",

      "At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army\n",

      "American tourists \"were being taken to the Iranian border.\"\n",
      "The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained\n",
      "— all on the Iraqi side of the border.\n",
      "As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to\n",
      "support the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft\n",
      "was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces\n",
      "were sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.\n",
      "As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in\n",
      "northern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens \"for being too close to the border.\" The July report\n",

      "By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend\n",
      "Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM\n",
      "Sarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.\n",
      "In her new book, \"America by Heart,\" Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial\n",
      "Association, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by\n",
      "his views rather than his faith. \"Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,\"\n",
      "Kennedy said. \"I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.\"\n",
      "Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy's speech had \"succeeded in the best possible\n",
      "way: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either.\" Now, however, she says she has revisited the\n",
      "speech and changed her mind. She finds it \"defensive . . . in tone and content\" and is upset that Kennedy, rather than\n",
      "presenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an \"unequivocal divorce of the two.\"\n",
      "Palin's argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no\n",
      "religious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a\n",
      "test. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would\n",
      "not.\n",
      "If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate's religious affiliation to be \"reconciled.\" My uncle urged\n",
      "that religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would\n",
      "lead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and\n",
      "demean their opponents.\n",
      "Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance\n",
      "of a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and\n",
      "peace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church\n",
      "they belonged to.\n",
      "But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy for not \"telling the\n",
      "country how his faith had enriched him.\" With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path\n",
      "my uncle warned against when he said that a president's religious views should be \"neither imposed by him upon the\n",
      "nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.\"\n",
      "After all, a candidate's faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.\n",
      "Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?\n",
      "Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, \"rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services\n",
      "and education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools.\" She\n",
      "does not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in\n",
      "parochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he\n",
      "wisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax\n",
      "money should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.\n",
      "As a contrast to Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks during the 2008\n",
      "Republican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of \"how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were\n",
      "elected.\" After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies \"intent on\n",
      "establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.\"\n",
      "\"There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,\" Romney said. \"What do I believe about Jesus Christ?\"\n",
      "Romney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that \"Jesus Christ is the son of God.\"\n",
      "Palin praises Romney for delivering a \"thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in\n",
      "American public life.\" But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to\n",
      "respond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?\n",
      "When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect\n",
      "for the Constitution and the founders' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions\n",
      "should not play a role in political campaigns.\n",
      "Palin contends that Kennedy sought to \"run away from religion.\" The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made\n",
      "America so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that\n",
      "faith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those\n",
      "whose religious beliefs differed from their own.\n",
      "To demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the\n",
      "precise reason that America is exceptional.\n",
      "Palin's book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their\n",
      "beliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don't match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy\n",
      "Pelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for \"talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.\"\n",
      "Who is Palin to say what God's \"walk\" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?\n",
      "This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, \"But let\n",
      "us judge not that we not be judged.\" The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,\n",
      "contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others' souls and assess their worthiness.\n",
      "Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in\n",
      "fealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever\n",
      "interfered with his duty as president.\n",
      "My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister\n",
      "died in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT\n",
      "boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.\n",

      "Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled \"Suppose God Is -\n",
      "Black.\" And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he\n",

      "Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at\n",
      "times. But as we have seen, the hierarchy's positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring\n",
      "about those changes. That may not be Palin's theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would\n",
      "disagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.\n",
      "John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness\n",
      "and contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech.\n",
      "Palin, for her part, argues that \"morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs.\" That statement\n",
      "amounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would\n",
      "support such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction\n",
      "that Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show \"malice toward none, with charity for ail.\"\n",
      "Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth\n",
      "precisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,\n",
      "corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.\n",
      "Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn't read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesn't know it by heart. Or\n",
      "she may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don't know.\n",
      "I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-\n",

      "The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, but senators should make it clear to\n",
      "Moscow that they don't see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses.\n",
      "By CONDOLEEZZA RICE\n",
      "When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear\n",
      "threat by reducing offensive weapons,-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the\n",
      "wake of America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States\n",
      "and Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.\n",
      "Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment\n",
      "of a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real\n",
      "threat was that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world's most dangerous\n",
      "regimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states also\n",
      "pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United States\n",
      "and our allies.\n",
      "It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.\n",
      "The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence.\n",
      "While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a\n",
      "triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfully\n",
      "reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last\n",
      "year.\n",
      "Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and its\n",
      "reinstatement is crucial.\n",
      "Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if the\n",
      "treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administration's commitments.\n",
      "First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has\n",
      "led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of\n",
      "Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully\n",
      "fund the president's program.\n",
      "Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense\n",
      "strategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen\n",
      "Hadley.\n",
      "Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold War\n",
      "link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the\n",
      "\"interrelationship\" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will not\n",
      "limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.\n",
      "Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remain\n",
      "fully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing both\n",
      "potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.\n",
      "I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians\n",
      "need to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to\n",
      "intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.\n",
      "Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our\n",
      "missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently\n",
      "between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.\n",
      "After all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly.\n",
      "Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in the\n",
      "Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russia's unstable south—are dangerous.\n",
      "That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from\n",
      "tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russia\n",
      "knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is not in its\n",
      "interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran and its\n",
      "longstanding concern about Pyongyang.\n",
      "The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for a\n",
      "long time.\n",
      "After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. and\n",
